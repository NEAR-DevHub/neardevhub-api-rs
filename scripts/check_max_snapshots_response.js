      "I facilitate the payment processing of proposal submissions.

We utilize database tools to manage the payment process.\nThe DevHub community members have benefited by receiving their proposal payments much more timely, recently narrowing in on 48 hr turn around and reducing the administrative steps each contributor had to complete to receive payment. The larger NEAR ecosystem has benefited by reducing the amount of time spent by the NF Legal and Finance team members, as well as DevHub admins, on the proposal payment process. These process improvements brought additional controls ensuring overall accuracy as DevHub has a fiduciary responsibility to NF that grant funds are spent responsibly, payments are correct and appropriate KYC/KYB measures have been taken.\nWeek 09/23/2024 - 09/27/2024\nExtra time was spent setting up testing invoicing for the Treasury system and communicating with teammembers on various hurdles and outcomes.\nTotal hours 15 @$80/hr\nRate determination is below the low end of the average hourly contract rate ($87 - $162) for an accountant with the same years of experience. That average rate does not account for my 5 years of blockchain specific experience.
