This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s importance on the global economic stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeing present at flagship blockchain events such as Blockchain Rio helps the overall Near ecosystem, increasing the brand visibility and providing opportunities for ecosystem growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe primary target audience consists of developers of all levels and builders/startups (founders and CTOs/technical decision-makers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia, and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Developers in Brazil:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software developer community in Brazil is one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing in the world, reflecting the growing importance of technology and innovation in the Brazilian economy and society.

This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s importance on the global economic stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeing present at flagship blockchain events such as Blockchain Rio helps the overall Near ecosystem, increasing the brand visibility and providing opportunities for ecosystem growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe primary target audience consists of developers of all levels and builders/startups (founders and CTOs/technical decision-makers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia, and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Developers in Brazil:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software developer community in Brazil is one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing in the world, reflecting the growing importance of technology and innovation in the Brazilian economy and society.

It was a core feature in [event.app.create](https://devfolio.co/projects/eventsappcreate-ebe8) submitted to ETH Denver 2024 hackathon for [NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Web3 native event platform\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" track](https://ethdenver2024.devfolio.co/prizes?partner=NEAR), and has been used to organize @nearbuilders.near events for Consensus 2024 in Austin, TX. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee it live at [nearbuilders.org](https://www.nearbuilders.org/builddao.near/widget/Index?page=activity&tab=events), or inspect the widget directly [here](https://near.social/builddao.near/widget/components.events.Calendar).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![events app](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiaeek4wwq7ygbaxxipesgo5lmoygi7vvemjayzhbibqlkqrylnoly)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Existing Features\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Calendar month and list view modes\\\\\\\\n* Create event with title, description, link, time and date, specify organizers, location, tags, cover image\\\\\\\\n* Filter by date, title, location, organizers, and tags\\\\\\\\n* Supports recurring events\\\\\\\\n* Add to Google Calendar\\\\\\\\n* Theming with both light & dark modes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Design\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have existing designs by @ceciliavlso.near which include some features that have not yet been implemented, such as search, improved event previewing, and attendance recording. These designs may be improved upon depending on the desired functionalities. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[View Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/ZVfCNEHuD7tZKFmod3pjnh/Build-DAO---UX%2FUI-Design?node-id=3671-204539&t=MeWUj1kVC7uErAR9-0)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Potential Use Cases & Integration Points\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ecosystem-wide events browser (historically, @nearweek.near calendar)\\\\\\\\n* @events-committee.near event review and management, automatic event creation on proposal approval, white label proposal and calendar product\\\\\\\\n* [Hackbox](https://taikai.network/en/hackbox/about) hackathon calendar and viewer, potential exploration into [BOS-native hackathon platform](https://near.social/#/buildbox.near/widget/app)\\\\\\\\n* @devhub.near community add-on to display call schedules\\\\\\\\n* [Keypom](https://keypom.xyz/) events ticketing @keypom.near\\\\\\\\n* Customizable, dedicated events pages (similiar to [Partiful](https://partiful.com/) or [Luma](https://lu.ma/home)) deployed to [web4](https://github.com/vgrichina/web4) @web4.near\\\\\\\\n* Personal calendars, scheduling assistants, office hours\\\\\\\\n* Support for [Bitte](https://bitte.ai/)\\\\\\\\\\\\'s [Dynamic Minsta: Badge Evolution for Multi-Event Participation Bounty](https://github.com/Mintbase/templates/blob/main/bounties/dynamic_minsta.md) \\\\\\\\n* @sharddog.near mints, event/marketing analytics\\\\\\\\n* @rc-dao.near local event planning and coordination\\\\\\\\n* Public good open standards and sdks for easy event integrations in order to promote interoperability across the ecosystem and provide a helping hand to projects looking to break into the event space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technical Considerations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, the calendar and it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality is implemented entirely with widgets, accessing the calendar itself though an iframe loading [FullCalendar.js](https://fullcalendar.io/). While this version is already built and working, it may be worth considering migrating this code to a more conventional framework, while still maintaining its ability to be embedded in a BOS app and/or deployed to web4. This would depend on the desired functionalities and the expected committment to delivering a robust, maintainable application. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother consideration is where and how the event data is stored. Events are currently stored under the creator\\\\\\\\\\\\'s account in the [social-db](https://github.com/NearSocial/social-db) (social.near), and every event created by anyone appears on the calendar unless specifically filtered, using the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" function (no indexer). This could be replaced with a dedicated contract and/or indexer, although the permissionless, personal namespacing of the social contract may be advantageous. Of course, a hybrid approach may also be appropriate and custom integrations should be welcome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn any case, the current widgets can be embedded into any framework via the [near-bos-webcomponent](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/near-bos-webcomponent), and the methods to read or write to the social-db are accessible in any node environment by using the [near-social-js](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/near-social-js) SDK.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent requirements may require different solutions, and these considerations can always be revisited in later milestones after delivering a working MVP using what already exists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Call to Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease, if any of this seems worthwhile, comment your support, your requirements, or your intention to get involved. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeking active engagement from the NEAR community to shape this project. Here are specific ways you can contribute:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Feature Prioritization**: Comment on which features you believe are most critical and why.\\\\\\\\n2. **Use Case Feedback**: If you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re involved with any of the mentioned potential use cases, please share your specific requirements or how you envision using something. How can we help relieve your backlog?\\\\\\\\n3. **Technical Input**: For developers, we welcome your thoughts on the technical considerations mentioned, particularly regarding data storage, contract solutions, and framework choices.\\\\\\\\n4. **Integration Opportunities**: If you represent a project or initiative that could benefit from event integration, please outline your needs and how you\\\\\\\\\\\\'d like to collaborate. If you have other needs, feel free to share them.\\\\\\\\n5. **User Experience Insights**: Share any pain points you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve experienced with existing event management tools that this project could address.\\\\\\\\n6. **Volunteer Your Skills**: If you have relevant skills (development, design, project management) and would like to contribute, please indicate your area of expertise and what you\\\\\\\\\\\\'d like to offer.\\\\\\\\n7. **Be a User!**: Express your support and intention to use a solution, and be a part of our initial testing groups once we have a prototype ready. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour insights are crucial in ensuring these integrations meet the needs of the NEAR community. \", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearbuilders.nea\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"TBD\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"labels\": [\"Hackathon\", \"Bounty\"], \"accepted_terms_and_conditions_version\": 125233667}"

Events are currently stored under the creator\\\\\\\\\\\\'s account in the [social-db](https://github.com/NearSocial/social-db) (social.near), and every event created by anyone appears on the calendar unless specifically filtered, using the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" function (no indexer). This could be replaced with a dedicated contract and/or indexer, although the permissionless, personal namespacing of the social contract may be advantageous. Of course, a hybrid approach may also be appropriate and custom integrations should be welcome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn any case, the current widgets can be embedded into any framework via the [near-bos-webcomponent](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/near-bos-webcomponent), and the methods to read or write to the social-db are accessible in any node environment by using the [near-social-js](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/near-social-js) SDK.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent requirements may require different solutions, and these considerations can always be revisited in later milestones after delivering a working MVP using what already exists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Call to Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease, if any of this seems worthwhile, comment your support, your requirements, or your intention to get involved.
