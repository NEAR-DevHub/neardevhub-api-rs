The proposal seeks to develop a platform designed to receive key data from sensors that would measure essential parameters such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and water temperature. These indicators are crucial to evaluate water quality and detect possible contaminants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlueSense\\\\\\\\\\\\'s proposal includes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze this data in real time. Through machine learning algorithms, AI could identify patterns and trends that help anticipate water quality issues before they become significant public health risks. In addition, BlueSense proposes the registration of all data in a blockchain, thus ensuring the integrity and transparency of the information. This approach would ensure that the data cannot be tampered with, giving users confidence in the accuracy of water quality information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs part of the proposal, a dynamic map would be integrated into the platform to visually show the status of the different water sources that are being monitored.

The proposal seeks to develop a platform designed to receive key data from sensors that would measure essential parameters such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and water temperature. These indicators are crucial to evaluate water quality and detect possible contaminants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlueSense\\\\\\\\\\\\'s proposal includes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze this data in real time. Through machine learning algorithms, AI could identify patterns and trends that help anticipate water quality issues before they become significant public health risks. In addition, BlueSense proposes the registration of all data in a blockchain, thus ensuring the integrity and transparency of the information. This approach would ensure that the data cannot be tampered with, giving users confidence in the accuracy of water quality information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs part of the proposal, a dynamic map would be integrated into the platform to visually show the status of the different water sources that are being monitored.
