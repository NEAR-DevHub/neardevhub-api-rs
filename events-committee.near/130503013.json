Our company has successfully served over 50 clients, primarily in the Ethereum ecosystem. With growing client demand for NEAR Protocol solutions, I am committed to expanding our services into the NEAR ecosystem. Attending this hackathon will allow me to further our knowledge, build strong connections within the NEAR community, and showcase our skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Near RWA Tokenized Vault:**\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR RWA Tokenized Vault is a decentralized vault built on the NEAR Protocol that allows users to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, commodities, or other physical assets. The vault enables users to pool funds and invest in these tokenized assets, with the underlying asset values determining the pool\\\\\\\\u{2019}s overall value. Investors in the vault will earn returns based on the appreciation of the tokenized assets, providing a seamless way for decentralized finance (DeFi) participants to invest in real-world assets through blockchain technology.

Inspired by reCAPTCHA, it provides a security checkpoint for smart contracts by analyzing them for vulnerabilities before transactions are processed. By integrating NEAR AI, reCeption offers real-time contract analysis, helping both Web2 and Web3 platforms, such as e-commerce and decentralized applications, to securely handle cryptocurrency payments and other blockchain interactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur target users include developers, businesses, and everyday users who need a reliable tool to ensure their smart contracts are secure, making blockchain technology more trustworthy and user-friendly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe plan to showcase our working MVP during the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and further develop reCEPTION during the event. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve reCEPTION and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. We believe this project has the potential and secure to create Web2 & Web3 value in AI based securify solution.
