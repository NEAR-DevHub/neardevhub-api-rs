The platform helps developers access pre-trained AI models for tasks like smart contract auditing, RAG agents and more while allowing AI/ML researchers to earn money when others use their models. We built this on NEAR Protocol, taking advantage of its low fees and secure environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy Team has made individual posts and are conditionally approved :\\\\\\\\n[https://near.social/events-committee.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=79](https://near.social/events-committee.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=79)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Purpose**\\\\\\\\nWe are passionate about improving ValidAI and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem. We feel there is a lot of scope of improvement and a lot of scope in the project to create real world value. The Bangkok hackathon is a great opportunity for us to take our project to the next level, learn more, and engage with the community. It will also help us reach the vision we have for this project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Request for Travel Stipend**\\\\\\\\n We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re just asking for help with our flights to Bangkok, which costs $350 per person. We would love to work at a NEAR Hackerhouse if there is such a provision. If not we would request upto $200 per person for accommodation.

Developers can use AI models for tasks like auditing smart contracts, while AI/ML researchers earn through a subscription-based model when their models are used. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve built it to be user-friendly, secure, and affordable, leveraging NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Why We Need the Support**\\\\\\\\nAs students, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re covering as much as we can ourselves, but the flight cost is a bit of a challenge. This travel stipend would make it possible for us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on developing our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Conclusion**\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re eager to attend the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and continue building on NEAR. Your support would mean a lot to us and help us cover the travel costs we need to participate.

We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re Team ValidAI, a group of five students from IIT Roorkee, India, and we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re excited about attending the upcoming [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok. We recently built a decentralized AI project at ETHGlobal Singapore, and we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re now looking for some support to cover our flight costs to Bangkok. We will try to manage all other expenses like food ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\", \"category\": \"Bounty\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"DRAFT\"}, \"editor_id\": \"65cef53014c0eb6c9f046273bc4670921fec82d8fdc4ce8153f9231d4f589465\", \"timestamp\": \"1730327153731371233\", \"supervisor\": null, \"description\": \"#  **Introduction**\\\\\\\\nOur team created ValidAI, a decentralized AI marketplace, during ETHGlobal Singapore. The platform helps developers access pre-trained AI models for tasks like smart contract auditing, RAG agents and more while allowing AI/ML researchers to earn money when others use their models. We built this on NEAR Protocol, taking advantage of its low fees and secure environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy Team has made individual posts and are conditionally approved :\\\\\\\\n[https://near.social/events-committee.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=79](https://near.social/events-committee.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=79)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Purpose**\\\\\\\\nWe are passionate about improving ValidAI and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem. We feel there is a lot of scope of improvement and a lot of scope in the project to create real world value. The Bangkok hackathon is a great opportunity for us to take our project to the next level, learn more, and engage with the community. It will also help us reach the vision we have for this project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Request for Travel Stipend**\\\\\\\\n We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re just asking for help with our flights to Bangkok, which costs $350 per person. We would love to work at a NEAR Hackerhouse if there is such a provision. If not we would request upto $200 per person for accommodation. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re not requesting any additional funds for food, or other expenses\\\\\\\\u{2014}we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll handle those on our own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeparture: Delhi, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand\\\\\\\\nReturn: Bangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u{2192} Delhi, India\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Estimated breakdown:**\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $350\\\\\\\\nAccommodation cost per person: $200\\\\\\\\nTeam size: 5 students\\\\\\\\nRequest per student: $500 (Capping according to the T&C)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **About Our Project: ValidAI**\\\\\\\\nValidAI is a decentralized AI marketplace that connects developers and researchers. Developers can use AI models for tasks like auditing smart contracts, while AI/ML researchers earn through a subscription-based model when their models are used. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve built it to be user-friendly, secure, and affordable, leveraging NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Why We Need the Support**\\\\\\\\nAs students, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re covering as much as we can ourselves, but the flight cost is a bit of a challenge. This travel stipend would make it possible for us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on developing our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# **Conclusion**\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re eager to attend the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and continue building on NEAR. Your support would mean a lot to us and help us cover the travel costs we need to participate.
