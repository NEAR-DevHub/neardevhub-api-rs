Event Overview\\\\\\\\nTitle: ETHBerlin activation\\\\\\\\nDate & Format: 24.05.2024 In-Person\\\\\\\\nLocation: BREW conference for Coding Session & ETHBerlin Hackathon\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n2. Attending Team\\\\\\\\nMaria Magdalena Neu @mariamneu.near\\\\\\\\nMaria Yarotska @yarotska.near\\\\\\\\nBoris Polania @bpolania.near\\\\\\\\nSupporting: Mintbase local community members\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n3. Event Objectives\\\\\\\\nGoals: Engage Developers to build their ETHBerlin hacks on Near. Effectively Dev Acquisition & Retention\\\\\\\\nTarget Audience: Developers that will be attending ETHBerlin Hackathon. Obviously looking for Rust developers, but also calling in Solidity and AI interested devs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n4. Challenges & Themes\\\\\\\\nThe Coding Session will be led by @bpolania.near from NEAR DevHub. We are aiming to get a room for 2 hours where teams will first learn about possibilities on NEAR and then be incentivized to submit something. Each Submission (each TEAM) will be rewarded with 150USD.\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Schedule  \\\\\\\\nThe activation at BREW - which happens 1 day prior to ETHBERLIN - is supposed to make teams familiar with building on NEAR. Getting them familiar with all we have to offer.\\\\\\\\nIllia will hopefully be able to speak on the main stage and call devs to the workshop hosted in the afternoon at the same location, where they will learn and do a mini-hack activity. \\\\\\\\nFor these activities there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s the possibility to include Mintbase Templates (getting them involved), using Minsta. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n**Key Activities: **\\\\\\\\nBREW, as mentioned, is a chain agnostic 1 day long conference that happens very close to the ETHBerlin location on the day prior to ETHBerlin start. They have Polygon as the other speciality sponsor - their main narrative is AI & Near would be focusing on chain abstraction.\\\\\\\\nOur workshop is planned in the afternoon at which the following themes will be talked about:\\\\\\\\n- presentation of the bounty booster\\\\\\\\n- hacking chain abstraction on Near\\\\\\\\n- mintbase Templates / mintbase wallet (supports ETH too)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n6. KPIs and Impact\\\\\\\\nKey Performance Indicators:\\\\\\\\n- Workshop attendees \\\\\\\\u{2013} 50 people\\\\\\\\n- Workshop Submissions \\\\\\\\u{2013} 10 submissions\\\\\\\\n- ETHBerlin on Near Submissions \\\\\\\\u{2013} 10 submissions\\\\\\\\n- ETHBerlin Hackathon winners which built on NEAR \\\\\\\\u{2013} 1 winner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nCommunity Impact: \\\\\\\\n- Visibility to what\\\\\\\\u{2019}s possible on NEAR in contrast to what isn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t yet on other layer ones \\\\\\\\n- Chain Abstraction on Near expansion \\\\\\\\n- New startups funneled into NEAR HZN\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Budget and Funding\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nBudget Breakdown: see [Budget Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OB4K3q-LAVOOEGuqExDMb0H2LlF4pXH_Z7mjXzcb2Mc/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nTotal Funding Requested: 23334 EUR\\\\\\\\nRequested prior to event: $19,635 (excluding submission incentives and bounty booster)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8.

Marketing and Promotion\\\\\\\\nThe hackathon at ETHBerlin does not need promotion. The coding session will be to promote NEAR to be used at the hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n10.
