Inspired by reCAPTCHA, it provides a security checkpoint for smart contracts by analyzing them for vulnerabilities before transactions are processed. By integrating NEAR AI, reCeption offers real-time contract analysis, helping both Web2 and Web3 platforms, such as e-commerce and decentralized applications, to securely handle cryptocurrency payments and other blockchain interactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur target users include developers, businesses, and everyday users who need a reliable tool to ensure their smart contracts are secure, making blockchain technology more trustworthy and user-friendly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe plan to showcase our working MVP during the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and further develop reCEPTION during the event. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve reCEPTION and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. We believe this project has the potential and secure to create Web2 & Web3 value in AI based securify solution. Engaging with the NEAR community during the hackathon will help us learn, gain valuable feedback, and push our project to the next level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Request for Travel Stipend\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re requesting a travel stipend to help cover our flights and accommodation for the hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $800 (Chandigarh, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand ; round trip)\\\\\\\\nAccommodation per person: $200\\\\\\\\nMy Request: $1000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI am only requesting assistance for flights and accommodation. We will manage other expenses such as food and local transport ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Project Overview:\\\\\\\\nreCEPTION is an AI-powered security platform that offers functionality similar to reCAPTCHA, providing automated verification solutions for both Web2 and Web3 environments. The project aims to enhance the security and quality of smart contracts and provide automated validation solutions for users and developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Past Projects\\\\\\\\nAdjoining the hackathons link i have participated in the past :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nETH Online 2024 : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eth-various-swusm \\\\\\\\nLFGHO 2024 :  https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ghotoevents-gy8os\\\\\\\\nETH Online 2023 :  https://ethglobal.com/showcase/tradecode-ddxrp\\\\\\\\nSustainable Development Hackathon:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pm0QT2IdAvZu22I_wz6w5TTluzEUrck3/view?usp=sharing\\\\\\\\nIBM Technovate : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJIp5vnCVf8gFGTX4qAucC1QSkE-8NT1/view?usp=sharing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Why I Need Support\\\\\\\\nAlthough I currently have no income, I am very interested in the Web3 ecosystem, and I really want to participate and contribute to global events.
