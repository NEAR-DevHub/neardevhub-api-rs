This platform allows users to predict crypto or stock prices, stake tokens, and participate in progressively harder rounds, with the chance to win bigger rewards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe plan to showcase our working MVP during the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and further develop Moraq Leagues during the event. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve Moraq Leagues and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. We believe this project has the potential to create real-world value in decentralized gaming and finance. Engaging with the NEAR community during the hackathon will help us learn, gain valuable feedback, and push our project to the next level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Request for Travel Stipend \\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re requesting a travel stipend to help cover our flights and accommodation for the hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight cost per person:** $350 (Delhi, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand, round trip)= **$700**\\\\\\\\n**Accommodation per person:** $200 / each = **$400**\\\\\\\\n**Team size:** 2 (Harshal and Sushmit)\\\\\\\\n**Total Request:** **$1,100**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are only requesting assistance for flights and accommodation. We will manage other expenses such as food and local transport ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Project Overview:\\\\\\\\nMoraq Leagues is a prediction-based gaming platform that offers a fun and competitive environment for users to predict crypto or stock prices. Users participate in multiple rounds, and after each round, the bottom 50% are eliminated. Players can choose to cash out early or continue for bigger rewards. We are excited to build Moraq Leagues on the NEAR Protocol, leveraging its low transaction fees and scalability.\\\\\\\\nWe are very old near fans and experienced in Near tech stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Projects\\\\\\\\nAdjoining few of our hackathons link we participated in the past :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1.

This platform allows users to predict crypto or stock prices, stake tokens, and participate in progressively harder rounds, with the chance to win bigger rewards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe plan to showcase our working MVP during the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and further develop Moraq Leagues during the event. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve Moraq Leagues and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. We believe this project has the potential to create real-world value in decentralized gaming and finance. Engaging with the NEAR community during the hackathon will help us learn, gain valuable feedback, and push our project to the next level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Request for Travel Stipend \\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re requesting a travel stipend to help cover our flights and accommodation for the hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight cost per person:** $350 (Delhi, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand, round trip)= **$700**\\\\\\\\n**Accommodation per person:** $200 / each = **$400**\\\\\\\\n**Team size:** 2 (Harshal and Sushmit)\\\\\\\\n**Total Request:** **$1,100**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are only requesting assistance for flights and accommodation. We will manage other expenses such as food and local transport ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Project Overview:\\\\\\\\nMoraq Leagues is a prediction-based gaming platform that offers a fun and competitive environment for users to predict crypto or stock prices. Users participate in multiple rounds, and after each round, the bottom 50% are eliminated. Players can choose to cash out early or continue for bigger rewards. We are excited to build Moraq Leagues on the NEAR Protocol, leveraging its low transaction fees and scalability.\\\\\\\\nWe are very old near fans and experienced in Near tech stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Projects\\\\\\\\nAdjoining few of our hackathons link we participated in the past :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1.

Your support would allow us to attend the hackathon and focus on building and improving our project without financial strain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\\\\\nWe are eager to attend the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok to showcase Moraq Leagues and continue developing on NEAR. Your support would mean a lot to us and enable us to bring our project to life.\\\\\\\\nThank you for considering our request.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"f58a611082e5f7d913749144019b7a4e355049a2be5d1574f107c65b26298a14\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"1100\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"author_id\": \"f58a611082e5f7d913749144019b7a4e355049a2be5d1574f107c65b26298a14\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
