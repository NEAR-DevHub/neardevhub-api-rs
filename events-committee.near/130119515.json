We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re Team ValidAI, a group of five students from IIT Roorkee, India, and we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re excited about attending the upcoming [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok. We recently built a decentralized AI project at ETHGlobal Singapore, and we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re now looking for some support to cover our flight costs to Bangkok. We will try to manage all other expenses like food ourselves.\", \"category\": \"Bounty\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"DRAFT\"}, \"supervisor\": null, \"description\": \"## Introduction\\\\\\\\nOur team created ValidAI, a decentralized AI marketplace, during ETHGlobal Singapore. The platform helps developers access pre-trained AI models for tasks like smart contract auditing, RAG agents and more while allowing AI/ML researchers to earn money when others use their models. We built this on NEAR Protocol, taking advantage of its low fees and secure environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Purpose\\\\\\\\nWe are passionate about improving ValidAI and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem. We feel there is a lot of scope of improvement and a lot of scope in the project to create real world value. The Bangkok hackathon is a great opportunity for us to take our project to the next level, learn more, and engage with the community. It will also help us reach the vision we have for this project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Request for Travel Stipend\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re just asking for help with our flights to Bangkok, which costs $350 per person. We would love to work at a NEAR Hackerhouse if there is such a provision. If not we would request upto $200 per person for accommodation. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re not requesting any additional funds for food, or other expenses\\\\\\\\u{2014}we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll handle those on our own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeparture: Delhi, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand\\\\\\\\nReturn: Bangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u{2192} Delhi, India\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Estimated breakdown:\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $350\\\\\\\\nAccommodation cost per person: $200\\\\\\\\nTeam size: 5 students\\\\\\\\nRequest per student: $500 (Capping according to the T&C)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## About Our Project: ValidAI\\\\\\\\nValidAI is a decentralized AI marketplace that connects developers and researchers. Developers can use AI models for tasks like auditing smart contracts, while AI/ML researchers earn through a subscription-based model when their models are used. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve built it to be user-friendly, secure, and affordable, leveraging NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Why We Need the Support\\\\\\\\nAs students, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re covering as much as we can ourselves, but the flight cost is a bit of a challenge. This travel stipend would make it possible for us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on developing our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re eager to attend the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and continue building on NEAR. Your support would mean a lot to us and help us cover the travel costs we need to participate.

We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve Moraq Leagues and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem.

Users participate in multiple rounds, and after each round, the bottom 50% are eliminated. Players can choose to cash out early or continue for bigger rewards. We are excited to build Moraq Leagues on the NEAR Protocol, leveraging its low transaction fees and scalability.\\\\\\\\nWe are very old near fans and experienced in Near tech stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Projects\\\\\\\\nAdjoining few of our hackathons link we participated in the past :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe started Moraq Leagues here : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/moraq-league-e14rc\\\\\\\\nbut we were not able to make a concrete version during Ethglobal Singapore, where we met @codegoon and amazing near folks at near booth and which lead us to go deeper into near Ai agents that can help us make prediction bots for crypto prices on top of moraq Leagues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPhotostock - Nearcon 2023 Lisbon Portugal Link : https://devpost.com/software/photostock\\\\\\\\nFunctionland Innovation Boost Zone - Near Metabuild 3 Link : https://devpost.com/software/functionland-innovation-boost-zone\\\\\\\\nWagerbox - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/wagerbox-0nej9\\\\\\\\nBlitzsquad - ETHGlobal Showcase : .https://ethglobal.com/showcase/blitzsquad-2jt43\\\\\\\\nPlayAstra - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/playastra-nsc3w\\\\\\\\nTribeviz - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/tribeviz-a3za7\\\\\\\\nSuperwallet - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/superwallet-wvqtj\\\\\\\\nPassportGlobal - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/passportglobal-jptoi\\\\\\\\nERCMEME BASE HACK : https://devfolio.co/projects/ercmeme-9760\\\\\\\\nETHMUMBAI 2024 : https://devfolio.co/projects/whispercash-a588\\\\\\\\nChainlink Hack : https://devpost.com/software/dna-id https://devpost.com/software/chainlink-wrapper-for-fxblox-staking-v0-2-functions\\\\\\\\nhttps://ethglobal.com/showcase/moraq-league-e14rc\\\\\\\\nAptos Winterschool Project: TribeBet : https://pitch.com/v/TribeBet-49ggp4/2923de38-72e3-436c-abcd-8339cab40cfe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand Many more exciting projects \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why I Need Support\\\\\\\\nAs a student coming from a economically weak background, I am committed to towards REDACTED online hack and on track of a very cool submission, but the cost of flights is a bit challenging for me. Your support would allow me to attend the hackathon ie. IRL Redacted in Bangkok and focus on building and improving our project without any financial strain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\\\\\nI am eager to attend the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok to showcase Moraq Leagues and continue developing on NEAR.
