We see a lot of potential in our platform to create real-world value by streamlining development processes with AI and BOS components. The Bangkok hackathon offers an incredible opportunity for us to take this project further, engage with like-minded developers, and learn from the NEAR community. Attending the event will help us refine our vision and push the boundaries of what\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible with our project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Request for Travel Stipend:**\\\\\\\\nWe are seeking assistance with flights to Bangkok, which cost approximately $350 per person. We would also greatly appreciate staying at a NEAR Hackerhouse if available. If not, we request up to $200 per person for accommodation. We are not requesting any additional funds for food or miscellaneous expenses, as we plan to cover those ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeparture: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn: Bangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u{2192} Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Estimated breakdown:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Flight cost per person: $350\\\\\\\\n- Accommodation cost per person: $200\\\\\\\\n- Team size: 4 students\\\\\\\\n- Request per student: $500 (Capping according to T&C)\\\\\\\\n- Total: $2000 (We can pay $1500 for ourselves)\\\\\\\\n- Total request: $500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **About Our Project: Frontend Flow with NEAR BOS and AI**\\\\\\\\nOur project integrates NEAR BOS components with AI-driven code suggestions to simplify the frontend development process. We provide a visual React flow interface, allowing developers to see how components interact. This approach enhances the efficiency and clarity of development workflows, particularly within decentralized applications. By contributing to the NEAR ecosystem, we aim to make Web3 development more accessible to all.\\\\\\\\nExplore ours project apply to REDACTED Bangkok: https://www.nearstack.weminal.com/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Past Project:**\\\\\\\\nWedata - 3RD Native track at Web3Hackfest: https://devfolio.co/projects/wedata-3418\\\\\\\\nFastUI - Fast component UI on BOS at BOS hacks: https://near.social/fastui.near/widget/FastUI\\\\\\\\nBOS wallet - BOS wallet on NearSocial at BOS hacks: https://near.social/pichtran.near/widget/BOSwallet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **About my team:**\\\\\\\\nPhuc Tinh: AI engineer; First author of a paper at PACLIC 37 Conference (2023) - Rank C; Co-author of a paper in Neural Computing and Applications journal (Q1, accepted 2024).\\\\\\\\nQuiVo: Blockchain Developer; 3RD Native track at Web3Hackfest with Wedata.\\\\\\\\nTung Le: Technical Lead.\\\\\\\\nLoc Hoang: Fullstack Developer.\\\\\\\\nPich Tran: Blockchain Developer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhy We Need the Support\\\\\\\\nAs students, we are managing most expenses on our own, but the flight costs present a challenge.
