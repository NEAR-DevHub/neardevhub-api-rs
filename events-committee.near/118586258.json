Challenges & Themes\\\\\\\\nThe Coding Session will be led by @bpolania.near from NEAR DevHub. We are aiming to get a room for 2 hours where teams will first learn about possibilities on NEAR and then be incentivized to submit something. Each Submission (each TEAM) will be rewarded with 150USD.\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Schedule  \\\\\\\\nThe activation at BREW - which happens 1 day prior to ETHBERLIN - is supposed to make teams familiar with building on NEAR. Getting them familiar with all we have to offer.\\\\\\\\nIllia will hopefully be able to speak on the main stage and call devs to the workshop hosted in the afternoon at the same location, where they will learn and do a mini-hack activity. \\\\\\\\nFor these activities there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s the possibility to include Mintbase Templates (getting them involved), using Minsta. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n**Key Activities: **\\\\\\\\nBREW, as mentioned, is a chain agnostic 1 day long conference that happens very close to the ETHBerlin location on the day prior to ETHBerlin start.
