With chain abstraction, developers can create a unified experience that abstracts away the complexities of different chains, such as transaction formats, consensus mechanisms, and token standards. This approach opens up possibilities for truly interoperable applications that can leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains, such as NEAR, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and more.\\\\\\\\n**Expected solution**\\\\\\\\nA fully functional dApp that uses chain abstraction techniques to interact with multiple blockchains, providing a unified and simplified user experience.\\\\\\\\nThe dApp should enable actions such as cross-chain token transfers, asset swaps, or data synchronization, with all complexity hidden from the end user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### **Bitte Protocol**\\\\\\\\n**Introduction**\\\\\\\\nThe future of Web3 is AI. As open source models flourish and decentralized infrastructure evolves, the integration of strong cryptocurrency custody, a simpler user experience (via AI prompts and agents), and advanced AI control has the potential to transform Web3. We expect to see agents that improve security, enhance privacy, increase adoption, and support decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy registering your agent as a plugin in the Bitte Wallet, you will allow Bitte Wallet users to take advantage of the launch of an agent that Bitte Wallet users will be able to interact with directly through the AI \\\\\\\\u{200b}\\\\\\\\u{200b}tab in the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected Solution**\\\\\\\\nSuccessful submissions will achieve plugin verification within the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### **Decentralized IA**\\\\\\\\n**Introduction**\\\\\\\\nThe intersection of AI and blockchain technology is revolutionizing the decentralized ecosystem. By integrating AI into decentralized systems, we can improve decision-making, automate complex processes, and deliver personalized user experiences, all while maintaining privacy and security. With platforms like NEAR Protocol, we can deploy AI models that operate on a decentralized infrastructure, ensuring data integrity and censorship resistance. Your task is to leverage these technologies to build an AI-powered dApp (decentralized application) that interacts with blockchain smart contracts, providing unique and valuable services to users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected Solution**\\\\\\\\nA fully functional AI-powered dApp that consumes and interacts with a smart contract, adding significant value to the user.\\\\\\\\nUse cases can include predictive analytics, autonomous agents, recommendation engines, or any AI-driven decision-making system that operates in a decentralized environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### chedule and Activities\\\\\\\\nDuration: 3 days IRL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Captura desde 2024-09-24 22-16-46|558x390, 100%](https://i.ibb.co/34qwdK3/Captura-desde-2024-09-24-22-16-46.png)\\\\\\\\n*show the full table in this Google Docs | [LInk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTCoV3yu-M66hlqevHlt3oeC2eec5OegxLR0TsmQWJA/edit#heading=h.7xmrn16jgvhi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### KPIs\\\\\\\\u{1f3af}\\\\\\\\n* 120 registered participants\\\\\\\\n* 10-15 projects created using Blockchain Operating System technology or decentralized IA\\\\\\\\n* 100 new NEAR Protocol wallets\\\\\\\\n* Partner with 3 universities for the celebration of the hackathon\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget\\\\\\\\nTo see the full cost breakdown of the event, please visit the following document\\\\\\\\n[Budget layout - M\\\\\\\\u{e9}xico node](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmIZieBWv1b3CNi2mIs-5swpiBKeCbeU6WAtUBlEHnA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n**Total for the hackathon:** 14250 USD + 3000 USD in prizes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Bounties and Prizes\\\\\\\\nEach proposed bounty can be awarded with up to 1000 USD, this will vary depending on the level of development achieved and the viability of the proposed project.\\\\\\\\nThe prize delivery process will be carried out by hackbox, once the Open Web Academy notifies the winners of the different challenges.

With chain abstraction, developers can create a unified experience that abstracts away the complexities of different chains, such as transaction formats, consensus mechanisms, and token standards. This approach opens up possibilities for truly interoperable applications that can leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains, such as NEAR, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and more.\\\\\\\\n**Expected solution**\\\\\\\\nA fully functional dApp that uses chain abstraction techniques to interact with multiple blockchains, providing a unified and simplified user experience.\\\\\\\\nThe dApp should enable actions such as cross-chain token transfers, asset swaps, or data synchronization, with all complexity hidden from the end user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### **Bitte Protocol**\\\\\\\\n**Introduction**\\\\\\\\nThe future of Web3 is AI. As open source models flourish and decentralized infrastructure evolves, the integration of strong cryptocurrency custody, a simpler user experience (via AI prompts and agents), and advanced AI control has the potential to transform Web3. We expect to see agents that improve security, enhance privacy, increase adoption, and support decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy registering your agent as a plugin in the Bitte Wallet, you will allow Bitte Wallet users to take advantage of the launch of an agent that Bitte Wallet users will be able to interact with directly through the AI \\\\\\\\u{200b}\\\\\\\\u{200b}tab in the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected Solution**\\\\\\\\nSuccessful submissions will achieve plugin verification within the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### **Decentralized IA**\\\\\\\\n**Introduction**\\\\\\\\nThe intersection of AI and blockchain technology is revolutionizing the decentralized ecosystem. By integrating AI into decentralized systems, we can improve decision-making, automate complex processes, and deliver personalized user experiences, all while maintaining privacy and security. With platforms like NEAR Protocol, we can deploy AI models that operate on a decentralized infrastructure, ensuring data integrity and censorship resistance. Your task is to leverage these technologies to build an AI-powered dApp (decentralized application) that interacts with blockchain smart contracts, providing unique and valuable services to users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected Solution**\\\\\\\\nA fully functional AI-powered dApp that consumes and interacts with a smart contract, adding significant value to the user.\\\\\\\\nUse cases can include predictive analytics, autonomous agents, recommendation engines, or any AI-driven decision-making system that operates in a decentralized environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### chedule and Activities\\\\\\\\nDuration: 3 days IRL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Captura desde 2024-09-24 22-16-46|558x390, 100%](https://i.ibb.co/34qwdK3/Captura-desde-2024-09-24-22-16-46.png)\\\\\\\\n*show the full table in this Google Docs | [LInk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTCoV3yu-M66hlqevHlt3oeC2eec5OegxLR0TsmQWJA/edit#heading=h.7xmrn16jgvhi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### KPIs\\\\\\\\u{1f3af}\\\\\\\\n* 120 registered participants\\\\\\\\n* 10-15 projects created using Blockchain Operating System technology or decentralized IA\\\\\\\\n* 100 new NEAR Protocol wallets\\\\\\\\n* Partner with 3 universities for the celebration of the hackathon\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget\\\\\\\\nTo see the full cost breakdown of the event, please visit the following document\\\\\\\\n[Budget layout - M\\\\\\\\u{e9}xico node](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmIZieBWv1b3CNi2mIs-5swpiBKeCbeU6WAtUBlEHnA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n**Total for the hackathon:** 14250 USD + 3000 USD in prizes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Bounties and Prizes\\\\\\\\nEach proposed bounty can be awarded with up to 1000 USD, this will vary depending on the level of development achieved and the viability of the proposed project.\\\\\\\\nThe prize delivery process will be carried out by hackbox, once the Open Web Academy notifies the winners of the different challenges. Each awarded team must go through the processes required to collect the prizes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Judging Criteria\\\\\\\\nWhile it is true that each challenge will have its own particular criteria for evaluation, all will follow a common line to measure the level of development: Ready to use and validated, Deployed, Idea and simulation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|Level|Acceptance criteria|\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n|Ready to use and validated|* Prototype deployed on mainnet * An iteration was made to test its value proposition to users. * It makes use of NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.|\\\\\\\\n|Deployed|* Prototype deployed on mainnet * Has a defined market and value proposition. * Makes use of NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.|\\\\\\\\n|Idea and simulation|*Presents a mockup or UI design to help evaluate the idea. *Uses NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Contact Information\\\\\\\\n**Our team includes:**\\\\\\\\n* Alan Estrada (@alan777.near): NEAR certified developer and co-founder of web 3.0 projects at NEAR.\\\\\\\\n* Irving Cari\\\\\\\\u{f1}o (@izcc.near): Certified NEAR Analyst, NEAR Professor and Google Lv2 Professor.\\\\\\\\n* Yair Nava (@yairnava.near): Backend developer with experience in RUST and Solidity, mentor of technical workshops\\\\\\\\n*  Luis Daniel (@syi216.near): Front end developer, with experience in BOS.
