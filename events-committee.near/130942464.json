We provide a visual React flow interface, allowing developers to see how components interact. This approach enhances the efficiency and clarity of development workflows, particularly within decentralized applications. By contributing to the NEAR ecosystem, we aim to make Web3 development more accessible to all.\\\\\\\\nExplore ours project apply to REDACTED Bangkok: https://www.nearstack.weminal.com/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Past Project:**\\\\\\\\nWedata - 3RD Native track at Web3Hackfest: https://devfolio.co/projects/wedata-3418\\\\\\\\nFastUI - Fast component UI on BOS at BOS hacks: https://near.social/fastui.near/widget/FastUI\\\\\\\\nBOS wallet - BOS wallet on NearSocial at BOS hacks: https://near.social/pichtran.near/widget/BOSwallet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **About my team:**\\\\\\\\nPhuc Tinh: AI engineer; First author of a paper at PACLIC 37 Conference (2023) - Rank C; Co-author of a paper in Neural Computing and Applications journal (Q1, accepted 2024).\\\\\\\\nQuiVo: Blockchain Developer; 3RD Native track at Web3Hackfest with Wedata.\\\\\\\\nTung Le: Technical Lead.\\\\\\\\nLoc Hoang: Fullstack Developer.\\\\\\\\nPich Tran: Blockchain Developer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhy We Need the Support\\\\\\\\nAs students, we are managing most expenses on our own, but the flight costs present a challenge. This travel stipend would enable us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on building our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem, rather than worrying about travel logistics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Conclusion:**\\\\\\\\nWe are excited about the opportunity to participate in the Bangkok hackathon and continue developing on NEAR. Your support would help us cover the necessary travel costs and allow us to concentrate on our project.
