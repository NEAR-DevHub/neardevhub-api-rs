This platform allows users to predict crypto or stock prices, stake tokens, and participate in progressively harder rounds, with the chance to win bigger rewards.\\\\\\\\nAnother part of it is an AI powered DEFI lending/borrowing platform which can be used to play more of the game\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe plan to showcase our working MVP during the [REDACTED] hackathon in Bangkok and further develop Moraq Leagues during the event. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to submit the online version of the project by October 25th and look forward to continuing work on it during the IRL hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Purpose\\\\\\\\nThe [REDACTED] hackathon is a fantastic opportunity for us to improve Moraq Leagues and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. We believe this project has the potential to create real-world value in decentralized gaming and finance. Engaging with the NEAR community during the hackathon will help us learn, gain valuable feedback, and push our project to the next level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Request for Travel Stipend\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u{2019}re requesting a travel stipend to help cover our flights and accommodation for the hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $420 (Mumbai, India \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand, round trip)\\\\\\\\nAccommodation per person: $240 (20$ hostel x 12 Nights)\\\\\\\\nMy Request: Actually $\\\\\\\\u{a0}660 (Coming from Mumbai , India. ie. South Asia = 500$ (420$ will be used in Flights and rest for Accomodation and rest Misc expenses )\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI am only requesting assistance for flights and bit accommodation. We will manage accomodation and rest expenses of food and other misc expenses on our own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Project Overview:\\\\\\\\nMoraq Leagues is a prediction-based gaming platform that offers a fun and competitive environment for users to predict crypto or stock prices. Users participate in multiple rounds, and after each round, the bottom 50% are eliminated. Players can choose to cash out early or continue for bigger rewards. We are excited to build Moraq Leagues on the NEAR Protocol, leveraging its low transaction fees and scalability.\\\\\\\\nWe are very old near fans and experienced in Near tech stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Past Projects\\\\\\\\nAdjoining few of our hackathons link we participated in the past :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI have participated in 30+ hackathons in last 2 years and have won more than half of them.\\\\\\\\nWe started Moraq Leagues here : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/moraq-league-e14rc\\\\\\\\nbut we were not able to make a concrete version during Ethglobal Singapore, where we met \\\\\\\\n@codegoon and mazing near folks at near booth and which lead us to go deeper into near Ai agents that can help us make prediction bots for crypto prices on top of moraq Leagues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPhotostock - Nearcon 2023 Lisbon Portugal Link : https://devpost.com/software/photostock\\\\\\\\nFunctionland Innovation Boost Zone - Near Metabuild 3 Link : https://devpost.com/software/functionland-innovation-boost-zone\\\\\\\\nWagerbox - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/wagerbox-0nej9\\\\\\\\nBlitzsquad - ETHGlobal Showcase : .https://ethglobal.com/showcase/blitzsquad-2jt43\\\\\\\\nPlayAstra - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/playastra-nsc3w\\\\\\\\nTribeviz - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/tribeviz-a3za7\\\\\\\\nSuperwallet - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/superwallet-wvqtj\\\\\\\\nPassportGlobal - ETHGlobal Showcase : https://ethglobal.com/showcase/passportglobal-jptoi\\\\\\\\nERCMEME BASE HACK : https://devfolio.co/projects/ercmeme-9760\\\\\\\\nETHMUMBAI 2024 : https://devfolio.co/projects/whispercash-a588\\\\\\\\nChainlink Hack : https://devpost.com/software/dna-id https://devpost.com/software/chainlink-wrapper-for-fxblox-staking-v0-2-functions\\\\\\\\nhttps://ethglobal.com/showcase/moraq-league-e14rc\\\\\\\\nAptos Winterschool Project Finalist at IIT Bombay : TribeBet : https://pitch.com/v/TribeBet-49ggp4/2923de38-72e3-436c-abcd-8339cab40cfe\\\\\\\\nhttps://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-winter-school-celebrating-innovation-collaboration-and-academia-with-trust-lab\\\\\\\\nCreator and Lead at : angrypets.io memecoin project\\\\\\\\nLead at supersol.xyz\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand Many more exciting projects\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Why I Need Support\\\\\\\\nAs a student coming from a economically weak background, I am committed to towards REDACTED online hack and on track of a very cool submission, but the cost of flights is a bit challenging for me.
