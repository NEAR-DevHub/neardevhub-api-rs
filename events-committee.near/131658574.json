With a simple click, Bob can confirm the transaction, opening a wallet modal where he can securely sign and complete the transfer. This streamlined approach eliminates the need to navigate complex Web3 interfaces, making blockchain interactions as simple as chatting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## On-Chain Interactions in Chat\\\\\\\\nUsers can perform a variety of on-chain operations right from the chat interface.

Users no longer need to switch between different platforms, as the chat AI handles and processes all requests in real-time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Seamless Web3-to-Web2 Transition\\\\\\\\nBuild Links integrates Web3 functionalities into a familiar Web2 chat experience. This accessibility lowers the entry barrier, making blockchain features easy to use even for those new to Web3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Request for Travel Stipend:\\\\\\\\nWe are seeking assistance with flights to Bangkok, which cost approximately $350 per person. We would also greatly appreciate staying at a NEAR Hackerhouse if available. If not, we request up to $200 per person for accommodation.
