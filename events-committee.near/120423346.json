Our mission is to shift the focus from the speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies to the practical applications of blockchain technology in everyday life. Our vision has always been to cultivate a unified community of web3 builders in Rome and across Italy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom its humble beginnings as a small group of friends, urbe.eth has grown into a thriving hub with 30 core contributors and over 700 active members engaging both online and in person.\\\\\\\\nIn addition to ETHRome, urbe.eth organizes events and initiatives regularly:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeTalks**: A series of monthly events, since September 2022, featuring four speakers per session sharing insights into web3 projects or concepts. Each event draws about 40 attendees and has included a range of international speakers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@urbetalks  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeForStudents**: In partnership with Sapienza University of Rome, this initiative has integrated web3 and blockchain education into the university\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Master\\\\\\\\\\\\'s program in Computer Science & Engineering, reaching students with lectures and practical sessions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stRIrvZZVTU  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVbUYoYeICc  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KWSFUezPPA  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh1-0LvLeZk  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeCampus**: A high-education program focused on web3 development, combining a five-day intensive boot camp with a practical two-day hackathon, guided by experienced mentors and supported by leading web3 organizations. urbe.eth has already organized 2 campuses. The inaugural UrbeCampus session took place just before ETHRome, from October 2nd to 6th, 2023, backed by TheGraph and Secret Network. A subsequent session was held from February 12th to 18th, 2024, this time with the full support of Arbitrum. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv16OfyiVco   \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeHackerHouse**: A new format launched in early 2024, focusing on updating community members with the latest technologies through workshops and product development sessions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/urbeEth/status/1776701532345360693 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese initiatives not only demonstrate urbe.eth\\\\\\\\\\\\'s extensive experience in organizing educational and developmental programs in the web3 space also highlights our proven capability to onboard new developers and engage a broader audience in the web3 ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Event Impact **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilding on the success of ETHRome 2023 (as described below in the KPI section), the upcoming edition aims to engage an even larger number of developers and sponsors, to grow the reach and thereby make a tangible impact on the Roman and International web3 ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nurbe.eth banks on its strong direct experience as builders, to deliver the most valuable event for builders. Having seen it all allows urbe.eth to shape ETHRome to retain the best features of the best hackathons: world-class talents and mentors, substantial prizes, and top-class sponsors. ETHRome embodies the fun and intimate elements of a only hackathon experience, while striving to contribute significantly to the development of the sector. Finally, ETHRome puts the Italian capital on the map, when it comes to cutting-edge web3 presence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs builders, we believe Privacy to be the most critical societal challenge, which we can address through web3. We also believe Account Abstraction to be the most urgent bottleneck for widespread adoption, to be addressed in web3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, ETHRome 2024\\\\\\\\u{2019}s **tracks will be Privacy and Account Abstraction**, directly tackling what we see as the most critical and the most urgent challenges of the web3 landscape, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur ultimate goal for ETHRome 2024, and wider urbe.eth initiatives, is to create an international web3 hub in Rome. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Funding Request **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are requesting a total of \\\\\\\\u{20ac}30.000 under the \\\\\\\\u{201c}Senator\\\\\\\\u{201d} Sponsorship category for ETHRome 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a pivotal part of our funding strategy, this support is crucial for delivering a high-quality event that remains completely free for all participants, including hackers and other attendees.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The allocated funds will be used as follows:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Event Logistics and Venue: Ensuring the event space is conducive to creativity and collaboration, including securing a venue that can accommodate our increased number of participants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Technological Support: Providing robust tech infrastructure essential for development activities, such as high-speed internet connection, power supplies, and on-site tech support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Catering and Amenities: Offering all-day catering to keep participants fueled and focused, along with other necessary amenities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Promotional Activities: Enhancing event visibility and participation through targeted marketing and promotional efforts. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the Senator sponsorship, Near Protocol will receive a comprehensive package designed to maximize brand visibility and engagement during ETHRome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Brand Visibility: Prominent branding throughout the event venue and in event-related communications and promotional materials.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Communication: The sooner Near becomes an official sponsor, the sooner it will be featured across ETHRome\\\\\\\\\\\\'s social media channels. Specifically, we guarantee:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclusion of Near in the official presentation of ETHRome one month before the event, which can be found here - https://x.com/ethrome/status/1699368016847237566?s=46&t=mKiZ-uJIBkxN1Abfee_G4g\\\\\\\\nA customized thread on Near similar to this one - https://x.com/ETHRome/status/1697882122994774452  \\\\\\\\nA post highlighting your bounties, similar to this example - https://x.com/ethrome/status/1706655579874222558?s=46&t=mKiZ-uJIBkxN1Abfee_G4g  \\\\\\\\nInclusion in the #roadtoETHRome format we used last year, which you can review herehttps://www.youtube.com/live/oQaEpgqiVBc?si=rfZoQ84EPpwTDWu5 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Dedicated Booth: A strategically located booth during the event to interact directly with participants and showcase Near Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technologies and opportunities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Workshop Slot: An exclusive 40-minute workshop slot to present Near Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology to hackers, illustrating potential uses and benefits in web3 development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project Bounties: The opportunity to offer up to $10,000 in bounties, encouraging the development of projects on the Near Protocol platform during the hackathon. (Bounty prizes will be managed directly by NEAR, so they will be outside of the sponsorship payment. It will be up to Near to decide the amount to provide and distribute, and Near will handle the payments of the prizes directly with the hackers) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Custom Sponsorship Add-Ons: Options to sponsor specific aspects of the event such as themed meals (pasta, pizza, gelato) or the closing party, enhancing the overall event experience and further promoting the Near brand.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis sponsorship will not only facilitate the logistical aspects of the hackathon but also ensure that participants have the resources needed to innovate and create without any financial barriers. Your support as a Senator Sponsor will be instrumental in fostering the development of groundbreaking web3 technologies by providing an optimal environment for learning and creativity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why having Near as a sponsor is important for ETHRome\\\\\\\\n**\\\\\\\\nThe participation of Near Protocol at ETHRome can play a crucial role, particularly given our focus on Privacy and Account Abstraction for the 2024 edition. Near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s pioneering implementation of Chain Abstraction offers a seamless and user-friendly approach to managing identities and transactions across multiple blockchains via one single wallet. We are very familiar with how Near unburdens the developer experience and enhances the accessibility and usability for end users. In exchange, Near can expect serious developers and builders at ETHRome, a culture that is aligned with its own and a very friendly environment that is most conducive to innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nETHRome 2023 garnered unanimous praise: it attracted 132 hackers, produced 40 innovative projects, was supported by 14 top-tier sponsors that distributed over $80k in bounties, gave birth to thriving projects still going strong today (e.g. https://www.fluidkey.com/), it offered a 4-day-long solidity boot camp for beginners and web2 veterans; all within a warm sunny backdrop, with open-air shaded hacking spaces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilding on the strong foundation of ETHRome 2023 and justified by the metrics above, we are setting ambitious targets for ETHRome 2024:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- We expect to attract over 200 hackers.\\\\\\\\n- We plan to facilitate the development of more than 50 projects, showcasing a broader range of innovation and creativity.\\\\\\\\n- We are preparing to welcome over 400 attendees, reflecting a growing interest in web3 technologies and our event.\\\\\\\\n- We anticipate partnering with at least 15 sponsors, increasing our collaborative network and support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese projected metrics demonstrate our commitment to scaling ETHRome as a premier event for developers, builders, and creatives in the web3 space, aiming to solidify its position as a catalyst for technological and community growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther Information:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Evaluation Factors **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe judging criteria for ETHRome 2024 will remain mostly unvaried from ETHRome 2023, as reported below:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJudging Criteria\\\\\\\\nThe project score (out of 100%) is calculated from the following judging criteria:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f3a8} Creativity (10%)\\\\\\\\nIs the project idea new and interesting? 0/5\\\\\\\\nDoes the project fit the Hackathon theme in an unexpected way? 0/5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f3cb}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f}\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\u{2642}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Feasibility (15%)\\\\\\\\nDoes the project solve a real problem? 0/5\\\\\\\\nHow likely is the project to be implemented in the real world? 0/10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f9ea} Innovation and Significance (25%)\\\\\\\\nHow innovative is the project? 0/10\\\\\\\\nHow impactful is the project in the Privacy and Account Abstraction areas? 0/15\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f468}\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\u{1f4bb} Code (50%)\\\\\\\\nDoes the project have a live working demo? 0/5\\\\\\\\nWas all of the stated functionality from the idea submission fully implemented? 0/15\\\\\\\\nHow hard was the project to build? 0/10\\\\\\\\nHow well does the project leverage the underlying technologies? 0/10\\\\\\\\nIs the application easy to understand and simple to navigate?

Our mission is to shift the focus from the speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies to the practical applications of blockchain technology in everyday life. Our vision has always been to cultivate a unified community of web3 builders in Rome and across Italy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom its humble beginnings as a small group of friends, urbe.eth has grown into a thriving hub with 30 core contributors and over 700 active members engaging both online and in person.\\\\\\\\nIn addition to ETHRome, urbe.eth organizes events and initiatives regularly:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeTalks**: A series of monthly events, since September 2022, featuring four speakers per session sharing insights into web3 projects or concepts. Each event draws about 40 attendees and has included a range of international speakers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@urbetalks  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeForStudents**: In partnership with Sapienza University of Rome, this initiative has integrated web3 and blockchain education into the university\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Master\\\\\\\\\\\\'s program in Computer Science & Engineering, reaching students with lectures and practical sessions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stRIrvZZVTU  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVbUYoYeICc  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KWSFUezPPA  \\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh1-0LvLeZk  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeCampus**: A high-education program focused on web3 development, combining a five-day intensive boot camp with a practical two-day hackathon, guided by experienced mentors and supported by leading web3 organizations. urbe.eth has already organized 2 campuses. The inaugural UrbeCampus session took place just before ETHRome, from October 2nd to 6th, 2023, backed by TheGraph and Secret Network. A subsequent session was held from February 12th to 18th, 2024, this time with the full support of Arbitrum. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv16OfyiVco   \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**UrbeHackerHouse**: A new format launched in early 2024, focusing on updating community members with the latest technologies through workshops and product development sessions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/urbeEth/status/1776701532345360693 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese initiatives not only demonstrate urbe.eth\\\\\\\\\\\\'s extensive experience in organizing educational and developmental programs in the web3 space also highlights our proven capability to onboard new developers and engage a broader audience in the web3 ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Event Impact **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilding on the success of ETHRome 2023 (as described below in the KPI section), the upcoming edition aims to engage an even larger number of developers and sponsors, to grow the reach and thereby make a tangible impact on the Roman and International web3 ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nurbe.eth banks on its strong direct experience as builders, to deliver the most valuable event for builders. Having seen it all allows urbe.eth to shape ETHRome to retain the best features of the best hackathons: world-class talents and mentors, substantial prizes, and top-class sponsors. ETHRome embodies the fun and intimate elements of a only hackathon experience, while striving to contribute significantly to the development of the sector. Finally, ETHRome puts the Italian capital on the map, when it comes to cutting-edge web3 presence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs builders, we believe Privacy to be the most critical societal challenge, which we can address through web3. We also believe Account Abstraction to be the most urgent bottleneck for widespread adoption, to be addressed in web3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, ETHRome 2024\\\\\\\\u{2019}s **tracks will be Privacy and Account Abstraction**, directly tackling what we see as the most critical and the most urgent challenges of the web3 landscape, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur ultimate goal for ETHRome 2024, and wider urbe.eth initiatives, is to create an international web3 hub in Rome. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Funding Request **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are requesting a total of \\\\\\\\u{20ac}30.000 under the \\\\\\\\u{201c}Senator\\\\\\\\u{201d} Sponsorship category for ETHRome 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a pivotal part of our funding strategy, this support is crucial for delivering a high-quality event that remains completely free for all participants, including hackers and other attendees.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The allocated funds will be used as follows:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Event Logistics and Venue: Ensuring the event space is conducive to creativity and collaboration, including securing a venue that can accommodate our increased number of participants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Technological Support: Providing robust tech infrastructure essential for development activities, such as high-speed internet connection, power supplies, and on-site tech support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Catering and Amenities: Offering all-day catering to keep participants fueled and focused, along with other necessary amenities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Promotional Activities: Enhancing event visibility and participation through targeted marketing and promotional efforts. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the Senator sponsorship, Near Protocol will receive a comprehensive package designed to maximize brand visibility and engagement during ETHRome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Brand Visibility: Prominent branding throughout the event venue and in event-related communications and promotional materials.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Communication: The sooner Near becomes an official sponsor, the sooner it will be featured across ETHRome\\\\\\\\\\\\'s social media channels. Specifically, we guarantee:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclusion of Near in the official presentation of ETHRome one month before the event, which can be found here - https://x.com/ethrome/status/1699368016847237566?s=46&t=mKiZ-uJIBkxN1Abfee_G4g\\\\\\\\nA customized thread on Near similar to this one - https://x.com/ETHRome/status/1697882122994774452  \\\\\\\\nA post highlighting your bounties, similar to this example - https://x.com/ethrome/status/1706655579874222558?s=46&t=mKiZ-uJIBkxN1Abfee_G4g  \\\\\\\\nInclusion in the #roadtoETHRome format we used last year, which you can review herehttps://www.youtube.com/live/oQaEpgqiVBc?si=rfZoQ84EPpwTDWu5 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Dedicated Booth: A strategically located booth during the event to interact directly with participants and showcase Near Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technologies and opportunities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Workshop Slot: An exclusive 40-minute workshop slot to present Near Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology to hackers, illustrating potential uses and benefits in web3 development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project Bounties: The opportunity to offer up to $10,000 in bounties, encouraging the development of projects on the Near Protocol platform during the hackathon. (Bounty prizes will be managed directly by NEAR, so they will be outside of the sponsorship payment. It will be up to Near to decide the amount to provide and distribute, and Near will handle the payments of the prizes directly with the hackers) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Custom Sponsorship Add-Ons: Options to sponsor specific aspects of the event such as themed meals (pasta, pizza, gelato) or the closing party, enhancing the overall event experience and further promoting the Near brand.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis sponsorship will not only facilitate the logistical aspects of the hackathon but also ensure that participants have the resources needed to innovate and create without any financial barriers. Your support as a Senator Sponsor will be instrumental in fostering the development of groundbreaking web3 technologies by providing an optimal environment for learning and creativity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why having Near as a sponsor is important for ETHRome\\\\\\\\n**\\\\\\\\nThe participation of Near Protocol at ETHRome can play a crucial role, particularly given our focus on Privacy and Account Abstraction for the 2024 edition. Near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s pioneering implementation of Chain Abstraction offers a seamless and user-friendly approach to managing identities and transactions across multiple blockchains via one single wallet. We are very familiar with how Near unburdens the developer experience and enhances the accessibility and usability for end users. In exchange, Near can expect serious developers and builders at ETHRome, a culture that is aligned with its own and a very friendly environment that is most conducive to innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nETHRome 2023 garnered unanimous praise: it attracted 132 hackers, produced 40 innovative projects, was supported by 14 top-tier sponsors that distributed over $80k in bounties, gave birth to thriving projects still going strong today (e.g. https://www.fluidkey.com/), it offered a 4-day-long solidity boot camp for beginners and web2 veterans; all within a warm sunny backdrop, with open-air shaded hacking spaces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilding on the strong foundation of ETHRome 2023 and justified by the metrics above, we are setting ambitious targets for ETHRome 2024:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- We expect to attract over 200 hackers.\\\\\\\\n- We plan to facilitate the development of more than 50 projects, showcasing a broader range of innovation and creativity.\\\\\\\\n- We are preparing to welcome over 400 attendees, reflecting a growing interest in web3 technologies and our event.\\\\\\\\n- We anticipate partnering with at least 15 sponsors, increasing our collaborative network and support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese projected metrics demonstrate our commitment to scaling ETHRome as a premier event for developers, builders, and creatives in the web3 space, aiming to solidify its position as a catalyst for technological and community growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther Information:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Evaluation Factors **\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe judging criteria for ETHRome 2024 will remain mostly unvaried from ETHRome 2023, as reported below:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJudging Criteria\\\\\\\\nThe project score (out of 100%) is calculated from the following judging criteria:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f3a8} Creativity (10%)\\\\\\\\nIs the project idea new and interesting? 0/5\\\\\\\\nDoes the project fit the Hackathon theme in an unexpected way? 0/5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f3cb}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f}\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\u{2642}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Feasibility (15%)\\\\\\\\nDoes the project solve a real problem? 0/5\\\\\\\\nHow likely is the project to be implemented in the real world? 0/10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f9ea} Innovation and Significance (25%)\\\\\\\\nHow innovative is the project? 0/10\\\\\\\\nHow impactful is the project in the Privacy and Account Abstraction areas? 0/15\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f468}\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\u{1f4bb} Code (50%)\\\\\\\\nDoes the project have a live working demo? 0/5\\\\\\\\nWas all of the stated functionality from the idea submission fully implemented? 0/15\\\\\\\\nHow hard was the project to build? 0/10\\\\\\\\nHow well does the project leverage the underlying technologies? 0/10\\\\\\\\nIs the application easy to understand and simple to navigate?

My involvement with Blockchain developers started back in 2022, I attended the Women Hack hackathon in Lisbon, then I co-organized Eth Barcelona Hackathon and hosted my first Hackathon in Madrid with Block&Change, a project I co-founded in 2023 where NEAR participated as sponsor.

For the past 18 years, I have owned and managed a successful restaurant in Barcelona, Spain, where I honed my skills in event organization, customer service, and operational management. This role demanded a high degree of adaptability, leadership, and fluency in multiple languages, enabling me to cater to a diverse clientele and manage large-scale events seamlessly. My background in computer engineering provides a solid understanding of technical needs and skills, which I have recently revitalized and expanded. I have been immersed in Web3 technologies since 2022. I have participated in seven hackathons as a developer, securing three prizes and I have attended as a volunteer in the latest EthOxford.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2.
