Many people feel discouraged from donating because they lack clarity and honesty about how their contributions are used, creating uncertainty and concern about fund management. In many cases, donors cannot track the impact of their donations or know if they truly reached the causes they intended to support. This diminishes trust in charitable organizations and reduces the flow of contributions to projects in urgent need of support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur proposed solution is a decentralized platform that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. The platform will include an AI agent integrated as an interactive chatbot in the user interface, allowing donors to make specific inquiries about the destination of their contributions. Donors can enter data such as the amount, the cause they wish to support, or the recipient of the funds, and the AI agent will process this information to track the status of the donation in real-time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe use of blockchain ensures that each transaction is recorded in a transparent and public manner, eliminating the risk of tampering or unreliable intermediaries. Each donation will be backed by smart contracts, which will automatically execute the agreed-upon rules and provide donors with a detailed view of how, when, and where their funds are being used. This means that donors can confirm at any time whether their money has reached the intended destination and how it is being used to create an impact on the causes they support.\", \"linked_proposals\": [45], \"receiver_account\": \"ashleyhiromi.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"750\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"author_id\": \"ashleyhiromi.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
