It is called [NEARCoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-cLcrGFBqI) and aims to integrate the upcoming NEAR AI platform.

I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m a fan of p2p sharing systems, and am curently building a Web3 Car-Sharing solution. Very close to GetAround in terms of functionality, Partage Car-Sharing allows users to rent cars owned by other users, generating a passive income from low-risk investments on one side, and unlocking cars on-demand everywhere in the world on the other side. The reason why it should be on the blockchain is to improve the existing sharing economy services by leveraging the best features of blockchain technology: decentralization, data privacy, self-sovereignty, and a more equitable distribution of economic benefits. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo I built a working backend last week, plan to ensure a first partnership with a car brand next week, and will wrap it all in a friendly frontend by the submission deadline, October 25th. My goal in Bangkok is to pursue this project IRL, engage more hackers and partners, and keep growing an early adoption crowd around this project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI will be flying from Barcelona, Spain, where I reside currently, and will try to book the same accomodation in Bangkok as the most participating hackers I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m in touch with. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour support is very much appreciated.\\\\\\\\nSee you there!\\\\\\\\nJulien\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"partage.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"1000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Travel expenses\"]}"
