With a simple click, Bob can confirm the transaction, opening a wallet modal where he can securely sign and complete the transfer. This streamlined approach eliminates the need to navigate complex Web3 interfaces, making blockchain interactions as simple as chatting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n####  On-Chain Interactions in Chat\\\\\\\\nUsers can perform a variety of on-chain operations right from the chat interface. Build Links supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Transfers \\\\\\\\u{2013} Instantly transfer NEAR tokens to other users.\\\\\\\\n- NFT Minting \\\\\\\\u{2013} Mint NFTs directly with a single command.\\\\\\\\n- Staking \\\\\\\\u{2013} Stake tokens within the chat for passive income.\\\\\\\\n- Other On-Chain Operations \\\\\\\\u{2013} Any interaction that can be executed on-chain, such as governance votes or smart contract calls.\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreickdzryobxg37adrbv7ia4c7rz6hxvctea6pxlndldew6wknjzzd4](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreickdzryobxg37adrbv7ia4c7rz6hxvctea6pxlndldew6wknjzzd4)\\\\\\\\n##### AI-Powered UI Generation\\\\\\\\nThe AI generates the necessary UI for each request, reducing user input and enhancing accessibility. Users no longer need to switch between different platforms, as the chat AI handles and processes all requests in real-time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Seamless Web3-to-Web2 Transition\\\\\\\\nBuild Links integrates Web3 functionalities into a familiar Web2 chat experience. This accessibility lowers the entry barrier, making blockchain features easy to use even for those new to Web3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Request for Travel Stipend:\\\\\\\\nWe are seeking assistance with flights to Bangkok, which cost approximately $350 per person. We would also greatly appreciate staying at a NEAR Hackerhouse if available. If not, we request up to $200 per person for accommodation. We are not requesting any additional funds for food or miscellaneous expenses, as we plan to cover those ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeparture: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn: Bangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u{2192} Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Estimated breakdown:\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $350\\\\\\\\nAccommodation cost per person: $200\\\\\\\\nTeam size: 3 students\\\\\\\\nRequest per student: $500 (Capping according to T&C)\\\\\\\\nTotal: $1500 (We can pay $1000 for ourselves)\\\\\\\\nTotal request: $500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### About Our Project: Frontend Flow and AI\\\\\\\\nAt Build Link, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re passionate about making blockchain accessible and intuitive. Traditional Web3 interfaces can be complex, especially for users not familiar with decentralized technology. Our mission is to break down these barriers by creating a Web2-friendly interface where users can conduct complex blockchain operations as easily as sending a message.\\\\\\\\nExplore ours project apply to REDACTED Bangkok: https://buildlink.vercel.app/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### About my team:\\\\\\\\nHuynh Anh: Blockchain Engineer.\\\\\\\\nAnh Tuan: Software Engineer.\\\\\\\\nVuong: FullStack Developer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Why We Need the Support?\\\\\\\\nAs students, we are managing most expenses on our own, but the flight costs present a challenge. This travel stipend would enable us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on building our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem, rather than worrying about travel logistics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Conclusion:\\\\\\\\nWe are excited about the opportunity to participate in the Bangkok hackathon and continue developing on NEAR. Your support would help us cover the necessary travel costs and allow us to concentrate on our project.

Built on the NEAR Protocol, Build Link uses AI to create seamless, interactive on-chain experiences within a chat interface, simplifying access to blockchain features for both seasoned Web3 users and newcomers.\\\\\\\\n#### Example:\\\\\\\\nBob: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want to transfer 2 NEAR to alice.near.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AI will interpret this request and generate an interactive user interface (UI) directly within the chat. With a simple click, Bob can confirm the transaction, opening a wallet modal where he can securely sign and complete the transfer. This streamlined approach eliminates the need to navigate complex Web3 interfaces, making blockchain interactions as simple as chatting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n####  On-Chain Interactions in Chat\\\\\\\\nUsers can perform a variety of on-chain operations right from the chat interface. Build Links supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Transfers \\\\\\\\u{2013} Instantly transfer NEAR tokens to other users.\\\\\\\\n- NFT Minting \\\\\\\\u{2013} Mint NFTs directly with a single command.\\\\\\\\n- Staking \\\\\\\\u{2013} Stake tokens within the chat for passive income.\\\\\\\\n- Other On-Chain Operations \\\\\\\\u{2013} Any interaction that can be executed on-chain, such as governance votes or smart contract calls.\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreickdzryobxg37adrbv7ia4c7rz6hxvctea6pxlndldew6wknjzzd4](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreickdzryobxg37adrbv7ia4c7rz6hxvctea6pxlndldew6wknjzzd4)\\\\\\\\n##### AI-Powered UI Generation\\\\\\\\nThe AI generates the necessary UI for each request, reducing user input and enhancing accessibility. Users no longer need to switch between different platforms, as the chat AI handles and processes all requests in real-time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Seamless Web3-to-Web2 Transition\\\\\\\\nBuild Links integrates Web3 functionalities into a familiar Web2 chat experience. This accessibility lowers the entry barrier, making blockchain features easy to use even for those new to Web3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Request for Travel Stipend:\\\\\\\\nWe are seeking assistance with flights to Bangkok, which cost approximately $350 per person. We would also greatly appreciate staying at a NEAR Hackerhouse if available. If not, we request up to $200 per person for accommodation. We are not requesting any additional funds for food or miscellaneous expenses, as we plan to cover those ourselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeparture: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam \\\\\\\\u{2192} Bangkok, Thailand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn: Bangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u{2192} Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Estimated breakdown:\\\\\\\\nFlight cost per person: $350\\\\\\\\nAccommodation cost per person: $200\\\\\\\\nTeam size: 3 students\\\\\\\\nRequest per student: $500 (Capping according to T&C)\\\\\\\\nTotal: $1500 (We can pay $1000 for ourselves)\\\\\\\\nTotal request: $500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### About Our Project: Frontend Flow and AI\\\\\\\\nAt Build Link, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re passionate about making blockchain accessible and intuitive. Traditional Web3 interfaces can be complex, especially for users not familiar with decentralized technology. Our mission is to break down these barriers by creating a Web2-friendly interface where users can conduct complex blockchain operations as easily as sending a message.\\\\\\\\nExplore ours project apply to REDACTED Bangkok: https://buildlink.vercel.app/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### About my team:\\\\\\\\nHuynh Anh: Blockchain Engineer.\\\\\\\\nAnh Tuan: Software Engineer.\\\\\\\\nVuong: FullStack Developer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Why We Need the Support?\\\\\\\\nAs students, we are managing most expenses on our own, but the flight costs present a challenge. This travel stipend would enable us to attend the hackathon and focus fully on building our project and contributing to the NEAR ecosystem, rather than worrying about travel logistics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Conclusion:\\\\\\\\nWe are excited about the opportunity to participate in the Bangkok hackathon and continue developing on NEAR. Your support would help us cover the necessary travel costs and allow us to concentrate on our project. Thank you for considering our proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBest regards,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTeam BuildLink\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"fastui.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"fastui.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
