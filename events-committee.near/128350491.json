This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s importance on the global economic stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeing present at flagship blockchain events such as Blockchain Rio helps the overall Near ecosystem, increasing the brand visibility and providing opportunities for ecosystem growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe primary target audience consists of developers of all levels and builders/startups (founders and CTOs/technical decision-makers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia, and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers in Brazil:\\\\\\\\nThe software developer community in Brazil is one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing in the world, reflecting the growing importance of technology and innovation in the Brazilian economy and society. With a robust technological ecosystem, Brazil has stood out not only in Latin America but globally as a significant hub for information technology talent and software development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSize and Growth:\\\\\\\\nAlthough specific figures may vary according to different sources, it is estimated that Brazil has over 400,000 software developers, with forecasts indicating continued growth in this number. This is partly due to investments in technological education and the increasing interest of younger generations in technology-related careers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEducation and Training:\\\\\\\\nBrazil boasts a strong network of higher education and technical institutions offering courses related to information technology, including software development, computer science, and computer engineering. Additionally, there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a proliferation of bootcamps, online courses, and training programs that facilitate the rapid development of specific programming and technology skills, enabling more people to enter the profession.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCommunities and Events:\\\\\\\\nThe Brazilian developer community is highly engaged, with numerous events, conferences, meetups, and hackathons regularly held across the country.

This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s importance on the global economic stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeing present at flagship blockchain events such as Blockchain Rio helps the overall Near ecosystem, increasing the brand visibility and providing opportunities for ecosystem growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe primary target audience consists of developers of all levels and builders/startups (founders and CTOs/technical decision-makers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia, and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers in Brazil:\\\\\\\\nThe software developer community in Brazil is one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing in the world, reflecting the growing importance of technology and innovation in the Brazilian economy and society. With a robust technological ecosystem, Brazil has stood out not only in Latin America but globally as a significant hub for information technology talent and software development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSize and Growth:\\\\\\\\nAlthough specific figures may vary according to different sources, it is estimated that Brazil has over 400,000 software developers, with forecasts indicating continued growth in this number. This is partly due to investments in technological education and the increasing interest of younger generations in technology-related careers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEducation and Training:\\\\\\\\nBrazil boasts a strong network of higher education and technical institutions offering courses related to information technology, including software development, computer science, and computer engineering. Additionally, there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a proliferation of bootcamps, online courses, and training programs that facilitate the rapid development of specific programming and technology skills, enabling more people to enter the profession.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCommunities and Events:\\\\\\\\nThe Brazilian developer community is highly engaged, with numerous events, conferences, meetups, and hackathons regularly held across the country.
