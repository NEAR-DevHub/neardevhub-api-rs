With chain abstraction, developers can create a unified experience that abstracts away the complexities of different chains, such as transaction formats, consensus mechanisms, and token standards. This approach opens up possibilities for truly interoperable applications that can leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains, such as NEAR, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and more.\\\\\\\\nExpected solution\\\\\\\\nA fully functional dApp that uses chain abstraction techniques to interact with multiple blockchains, providing a unified and simplified user experience.\\\\\\\\nThe dApp should enable actions such as cross-chain token transfers, asset swaps, or data synchronization, with all complexity hidden from the end user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBitte Protocol\\\\\\\\nIntroduction\\\\\\\\nThe future of Web3 is AI. As open source models flourish and decentralized infrastructure evolves, the integration of strong cryptocurrency custody, a simpler user experience (via AI prompts and agents), and advanced AI control has the potential to transform Web3. We expect to see agents that improve security, enhance privacy, increase adoption, and support decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy registering your agent as a plugin in the Bitte Wallet, you will allow Bitte Wallet users to take advantage of the launch of an agent that Bitte Wallet users will be able to interact with directly through the AI \\\\\\\\u{200b}\\\\\\\\u{200b}tab in the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpected Solution\\\\\\\\nSuccessful submissions will achieve plugin verification within the Bitte Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecentralized IA \\\\\\\\nIntroduction\\\\\\\\nThe intersection of AI and blockchain technology is revolutionizing the decentralized ecosystem. By integrating AI into decentralized systems, we can improve decision-making, automate complex processes, and deliver personalized user experiences, all while maintaining privacy and security. With platforms like NEAR Protocol, we can deploy AI models that operate on a decentralized infrastructure, ensuring data integrity and censorship resistance. Your task is to leverage these technologies to build an AI-powered dApp (decentralized application) that interacts with blockchain smart contracts, providing unique and valuable services to users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpected Solution \\\\\\\\nA fully functional AI-powered dApp that consumes and interacts with a smart contract, adding significant value to the user.\\\\\\\\nUse cases can include predictive analytics, autonomous agents, recommendation engines, or any AI-driven decision-making system that operates in a decentralized environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSchedule and Activities\\\\\\\\nDuration: 3 days IRL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey Activities\\\\\\\\nHour\\\\\\\\nDay 1\\\\\\\\nDay 2\\\\\\\\nDay 3\\\\\\\\nTBD\\\\\\\\nOpening\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdea planning talk\\\\\\\\nBuilding time\\\\\\\\nIntroductory talk on blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign thinking talk\\\\\\\\nSmart contract development workshop\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMentoring session for idea validation\\\\\\\\nMentoring session to monitor progress\\\\\\\\nLunch\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilding time\\\\\\\\nFinal pitch and prizes\\\\\\\\nDecentralized frontend development workshop\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKPIs\\\\\\\\u{1f3af}\\\\\\\\n120 registered participants\\\\\\\\n10-15 projects created using Blockchain Operating System technology or decentralized IA\\\\\\\\n100 new NEAR Protocol wallets\\\\\\\\nPartner with 3 universities for the celebration of the hackathon\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBudget\\\\\\\\nTo see the full cost breakdown of the event, please visit the following document\\\\\\\\nBudget layout - M\\\\\\\\u{e9}xico node\\\\\\\\nTotal for the hackathon 14250 USD + 3000 USD in prizes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBounties and Prizes\\\\\\\\nEach proposed bounty can be awarded with up to 1000 USD, this will vary depending on the level of development achieved and the viability of the proposed project.\\\\\\\\nThe prize delivery process will be carried out by hackbox, once the Open Web Academy notifies the winners of the different challenges. Each awarded team must go through the processes required to collect the prizes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJudging Criteria\\\\\\\\nWhile it is true that each challenge will have its own particular criteria for evaluation, all will follow a common line to measure the level of development: Ready to use and validated, Deployed, Idea and simulation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLevel\\\\\\\\nAcceptance criteria\\\\\\\\nReady to use and validated\\\\\\\\n* Prototype deployed on mainnet * An iteration was made to test its value proposition to users. * It makes use of NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.\\\\\\\\nDeployed\\\\\\\\n* Prototype deployed on mainnet * Has a defined market and value proposition. * Makes use of NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.\\\\\\\\nIdea and simulation\\\\\\\\n*Presents a mockup or UI design to help evaluate the idea. *Uses NEAR in its infrastructure to build its value proposition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMarketing and Promotion\\\\\\\\nTBD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nContact Information\\\\\\\\nOur team includes:\\\\\\\\nAlan Estrada (@alan777.near): NEAR certified developer and co-founder of web 3.0 projects at NEAR.\\\\\\\\nIrving Cari\\\\\\\\u{f1}o (@izcc.near): Certified NEAR Analyst, NEAR Professor and Google Lv2 Professor.\\\\\\\\nOur social networks\\\\\\\\nWebsite: https://ow.academy\\\\\\\\nYoutube: youtube/OpenWebAcademy\\\\\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/openwebacademy_\\\\\\\\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @openwebhouse\\\\\\\\nDiscord: Open Web Academy\\\\\\\\nMedium: Open Web Academy \\\\\\\\u{2013} Medium\\\\\\\\nGithub: https://github.com/open-web-academy \\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"open-web-academy.sputnik-dao.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"events-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"14250\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Hackathon\", \"Hackbox\"], \"accepted_terms_and_conditions_version\": 128799006}"

This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s importance on the global economic stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeing present at flagship blockchain events such as Blockchain Rio helps the overall Near ecosystem, increasing the brand visibility and providing opportunities for ecosystem growth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe primary target audience consists of developers of all levels and builders/startups (founders and CTOs/technical decision-makers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia, and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers in Brazil:\\\\\\\\nThe software developer community in Brazil is one of the most vibrant and rapidly growing in the world, reflecting the growing importance of technology and innovation in the Brazilian economy and society. With a robust technological ecosystem, Brazil has stood out not only in Latin America but globally as a significant hub for information technology talent and software development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSize and Growth:\\\\\\\\nAlthough specific figures may vary according to different sources, it is estimated that Brazil has over 400,000 software developers, with forecasts indicating continued growth in this number. This is partly due to investments in technological education and the increasing interest of younger generations in technology-related careers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEducation and Training:\\\\\\\\nBrazil boasts a strong network of higher education and technical institutions offering courses related to information technology, including software development, computer science, and computer engineering. Additionally, there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a proliferation of bootcamps, online courses, and training programs that facilitate the rapid development of specific programming and technology skills, enabling more people to enter the profession.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCommunities and Events:\\\\\\\\nThe Brazilian developer community is highly engaged, with numerous events, conferences, meetups, and hackathons regularly held across the country.

There is a particular interest in software solutions for fintechs, agritech, healthtech, and edtech, reflecting the unique needs and opportunities of the Brazilian market.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChallenges and Opportunities:\\\\\\\\nDespite the growth and dynamism of the community, there are still challenges to overcome, such as the need for greater diversity and inclusion in the tech sector and bridging specific skill gaps. However, the outlook for software developers in Brazil remains positive, with increasing demand for qualified professionals both in the domestic market and in global projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the software developer community in Brazil is a crucial component of the country\\\\\\\\\\\\'s technological ecosystem, playing a key role in innovation and economic development. With ongoing investments in education, training, and technological infrastructure, Brazil is well-positioned to continue its growth and impact on the global technology scene.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhy Not a Tech Academy in English?\\\\\\\\nThe establishment of a Tech Academy in Brazil, offering courses and training in Portuguese, is crucial given the current linguistic landscape of the country. Data reveal that only 5% of the Brazilian population speaks English, and a mere 1% are fluent in the language, according to a study by the British Council. This linguistic reality presents significant barriers to accessing technical knowledge and the latest developments in the tech sector, which are predominantly disseminated in English. Below, I discuss the main reasons why a Tech Academy in Portuguese is important in Brazil:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDemocratization of Access to Technological Knowledge:\\\\\\\\nA Tech Academy operating in Portuguese can democratize access to technological knowledge, allowing more Brazilians, regardless of their proficiency in English, to learn about programming, software development, artificial intelligence, among other relevant topics. This is especially important in a country with as much diversity and socioeconomic inequality as Brazil.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStimulation of Innovation and Local Development:\\\\\\\\nBy offering technological training in Portuguese, a Tech Academy can stimulate innovation and the development of technological solutions tailored to local needs. This not only contributes to the strengthening of the startup and technology ecosystem in the country but also promotes the solving of social problems through technology\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStimulation of Innovation and Local Development\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy offering technological training in Portuguese, a Tech Academy can stimulate innovation and the development of technological solutions tailored to local needs. This not only contributes to the strengthening of the startup and technology ecosystem in the country but also promotes the solving of social problems through technology.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSocial and Economic Inclusion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccessible technological training in the Portuguese language can be a powerful tool for social and economic inclusion, empowering individuals from different social strata to enter the growing technological labor market. This can help reduce economic disparities and promote a more equitable society.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopment of Local Talents\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the linguistic barrier mitigated, a Tech Academy in Portuguese can help identify and develop local talents, which might otherwise remain untapped. This is crucial for Brazil, which needs to expand its base of qualified technology professionals to compete globally and for the country\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sustainable development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStrengthening of the Digital Economy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTraining more technology professionals in their native language is strategic for strengthening the Brazilian digital economy. With more developers, data scientists, and information technology specialists trained within the country, Brazil can better position itself as a leader in technological innovation in Latin America and the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the creation of a Tech Academy in Portuguese is essential to overcome the linguistic barriers that limit access to knowledge and opportunities in the tech sector. This initiative can facilitate the inclusion of a larger number of Brazilians in the dynamic technology market, in addition to contributing to the socio economic and technological development of the country.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAbout Partner\\\\\\\\nPartner is an edtech initiative created by experienced professionals in the technology market.
