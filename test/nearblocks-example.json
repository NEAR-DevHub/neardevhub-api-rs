Here is how it works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecentralization of Data Sources\\\\\\\\nPrivacy and Control: Reduces dependency on centralized servers, allowing users to retain control over personal data like emails, calendars, and documents.\\\\\\\\nEnhanced Security: Decentralized nodes increase resilience and data security.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen-Source Language Model Integration\\\\\\\\nTransparency: Enables customizable, transparent models that avoid reliance on third-party, black-box solutions.\\\\\\\\nPrivacy-By-Design: Aligns with privacy-first principles, ensuring model processing occurs securely on-device.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlockchain-Based Compensation with NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\nAutomated Fair Compensation: Data providers receive payment based on data relevance and usage, fostering transparency and trust.\\\\\\\\nReal-Time Accountability: Tracks data interactions on-chain, ensuring tamper-proof, accountable compensation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUser Privacy and Data Ownership\\\\\\\\nAccess Control: Users retain granular control over shared data (e.g., email, calendar).\\\\\\\\nOn-Device Processing: Minimizes exposure to external systems, enhancing compliance with data privacy regulations.\\\\\\\\nEmpowerment Through Privacy: Privacy-by-design principles encourage user trust by ensuring data ownership and control.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEthical AI Development\\\\\\\\nFair Compensation and Data Ownership: Sets a standard for ethical AI by respecting data ownership and fairly compensating providers.\\\\\\\\nUser Privacy and Functionality: Balances AI functionality with strict data privacy, promoting responsible AI use.\\\\\\\\nCheck it out yourself if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t believe us! https://github.com/KonferCA/Seahorse\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScalability and Flexibility\\\\\\\\nModular Design: Accommodates various data sources and modalities, including multimodal capabilities.\\\\\\\\nScalability: Designed to scale with more extensive datasets and data types, increasing versatility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFoundation for Future Innovations\\\\\\\\nDecentralized AI Proof of Concept: Paves the way for future decentralized AI applications centered around data privacy and ownership.\\\\\\\\nOpen Infrastructure Development: Provides a foundation for projects focused on user privacy, data control, and decentralized compute.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow we built it\\\\\\\\nA decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a blockchain-based compensation model that prioritizes data ownership and privacy. The system processes personal data, such as Google Calendar entries, emails, and transcriptions, entirely on-device using advanced similarity search with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings. A secure, wallet-based routing system enables two users to exchange decryption keys, allowing access to shared calendar and event data stored encrypted on NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s blockchain. Compensation for data providers is managed through NEAR smart contracts, which distribute payments based on data relevance scores. Initially centralized for simplicity, the routing system is designed with future decentralization in mind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project aims to set new standards in ethical AI by combining privacy-focused, decentralized data processing with a fair, automated compensation structure for data contributors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn-Device System\\\\\\\\nOn-Device RAG System: An entirely on-device Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system pulls relevant information from diverse sources.\\\\\\\\nData Sources: Includes Google Calendar, Gmail emails, uploaded documents, voice transcriptions, and more.\\\\\\\\nVector Embeddings: Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to map text into a dense vector space for similarity searches.\\\\\\\\nFlexibility: Designed for plug-and-play functionality to accommodate new information as needed.\\\\\\\\nResponse Generation: Uses WebLLM to run Phi 3.5 Vision Instruct on-device for responses, pulling only relevant data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmart Contract Integration: Relevancy scores and data usage are logged for fair compensation calculation.

Here is how it works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecentralization of Data Sources\\\\\\\\nPrivacy and Control: Reduces dependency on centralized servers, allowing users to retain control over personal data like emails, calendars, and documents.\\\\\\\\nEnhanced Security: Decentralized nodes increase resilience and data security.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen-Source Language Model Integration\\\\\\\\nTransparency: Enables customizable, transparent models that avoid reliance on third-party, black-box solutions.\\\\\\\\nPrivacy-By-Design: Aligns with privacy-first principles, ensuring model processing occurs securely on-device.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlockchain-Based Compensation with NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\nAutomated Fair Compensation: Data providers receive payment based on data relevance and usage, fostering transparency and trust.\\\\\\\\nReal-Time Accountability: Tracks data interactions on-chain, ensuring tamper-proof, accountable compensation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUser Privacy and Data Ownership\\\\\\\\nAccess Control: Users retain granular control over shared data (e.g., email, calendar).\\\\\\\\nOn-Device Processing: Minimizes exposure to external systems, enhancing compliance with data privacy regulations.\\\\\\\\nEmpowerment Through Privacy: Privacy-by-design principles encourage user trust by ensuring data ownership and control.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEthical AI Development\\\\\\\\nFair Compensation and Data Ownership: Sets a standard for ethical AI by respecting data ownership and fairly compensating providers.\\\\\\\\nUser Privacy and Functionality: Balances AI functionality with strict data privacy, promoting responsible AI use.\\\\\\\\nCheck it out yourself if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t believe us! https://github.com/KonferCA/Seahorse\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScalability and Flexibility\\\\\\\\nModular Design: Accommodates various data sources and modalities, including multimodal capabilities.\\\\\\\\nScalability: Designed to scale with more extensive datasets and data types, increasing versatility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFoundation for Future Innovations\\\\\\\\nDecentralized AI Proof of Concept: Paves the way for future decentralized AI applications centered around data privacy and ownership.\\\\\\\\nOpen Infrastructure Development: Provides a foundation for projects focused on user privacy, data control, and decentralized compute.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow we built it\\\\\\\\nA decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a blockchain-based compensation model that prioritizes data ownership and privacy. The system processes personal data, such as Google Calendar entries, emails, and transcriptions, entirely on-device using advanced similarity search with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings. A secure, wallet-based routing system enables two users to exchange decryption keys, allowing access to shared calendar and event data stored encrypted on NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\u{2019}s blockchain. Compensation for data providers is managed through NEAR smart contracts, which distribute payments based on data relevance scores.
