Plans to hire a Product Marketer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Portfolio of relevant work:**\\\\\\\\nStream provides seamless access to blockchain raw data both real-time and historical blockchain data. An innovative solution by pushing data to users upon availability. This approach ensures faster, more reliable, and consistent data transmission, fostering trust in the accuracy and timeliness of the data you deliver. Unlike traditional data providers like RPCs or your own node and custom solutions.It efficiently retrieves and delivers transactional data to your preferred destination like S3, Webhook, Kafka etc., ensuring uninterrupted streaming, even during chain reorganizations while maintaining data consistency and with 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions enable to transform streamed data, boosting efficiency and reducing data size by retrieving exactly the data you need, when you need it. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s edge computing as a service! Just write a JavaScript transformation function & start receiving a stream of high throughput of enriched transformed data instead of raw data. \\\\\\\\nQuery Engine (POC & V1.0) provides sub-second results to the most complex data operations and queries across a contract/address and cross-chain. It is targeted to perform analytical queries with performance of regular oltp databases.\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexers (Research & POC) stream data of the indexed protocol and beyond. Instead of depending on slow, unreliable subgraphs with a GraphQL interface making it useless when it comes to use at scale. Super Indexers is the solution to all the problems which subgraphs bring along with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Proposal:**\\\\\\\\nThis proposal aims to add support to NEAR blockchains and bring the leading innovative solution by being a bespoke blockchain data infrastructure platform to the NEAR ecosystem. Project Zero has a Data extraction and transformation (Block functions), streaming product that eliminates the burden of handling and managing chain reorgs, data inconsistency, unreliable RPCs which are impractical to use at scale, and extremely costly. Project Zero is stepping into the next phases to solve a-z blockchain data-related problems which includes products like Rich API endpoints, Query Engine and Super Indexers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the current scenario, even with the fractional existing solutions, none of them are supporting NEAR blockchain besides The Graph. The following are the benefits for the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\nHuge incentive for the builders to launch on NEAR with a significantly reduce time to market dApp due to a free plug-and-play data infrastructure\\\\\\\\nNone of the so-called incumbent solutions support NEAR (Alchemy, quicknode, goldsky etc.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the problems we are solving are very fundamental and relevant wherever on-chain data is required, NEAR developer ecosystem (dApps) can reap all the benefits by saving up to 2x time-to-market and saving their previous limited funding by eliminating the need to maintain huge infrastructure and specialized backend developers. As part of the proposal, we would like to provide 100GB/month of free usage of Streaming + Block Functions at no cost of NEAR blockchain data for 12 months from the date of approval of the proposal. Project Zero is a closed source solution with its proprietary technology and algorithms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Goals / Milestones:**\\\\\\\\nAdding Near blockchains dataset from genesis: Q3 2024  \\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data: Always ongoing\\\\\\\\nImplement and provide free usage (100GB/month) of Project Zero data streaming of NEAR blockchain (Launch as soon as Task 1 is finished)\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products on Near: \\\\\\\\nFirst set of Rich APIs (Ex: Token API, Transaction history API etc.): End of Q3 or Start Q4 2024\\\\\\\\nMore sets of Rich APIs (always ongoing): Q4 2024 and beyond for more\\\\\\\\nData Lake and Query Engine on NEAR Blockchain: Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexers v1.0 on NEAR: End of Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24 or Beginning Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\nSupport other types of off chain and chain data like Price feeds etc.: Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe timelines are subjected to the proposal approval date. We are assuming the proposal gets approved well before the end of Q3\\\\\\\\u{2019}24. For the other new products (4-6), we will try to provide some Freemium usage for the NEAR community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Metrics:**\\\\\\\\nThe key success criteria or metrics are:\\\\\\\\nAdoption of Project Zero by NEAR dApps\\\\\\\\nUser retention\\\\\\\\nHigh NPS/CSAT score\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Competitor Comparison:**\\\\\\\\nWe don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t find any 1:1 competitor who is solving all the blockchain data infrastructure problems but we view competitors at specific products level.\\\\\\\\nStreaming & Transformation - Quicknode: Project Zero has an edge with the additional type of chain reorg handling strategy, performance of chain reorg handling, higher throughput and optimized block functions. On a fast blockchain like Arbitrum, Project Zero handles more than 4 blocks per second where the existing solution isn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even close to it!\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexer - The Graph (only major indexer supporting NEAR): Subgraphs on The Graph network lack usability at scale and are highly rate limited with GraphQL endpoints. Moreover the availability and freshness of real-time data isn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t common as the entire model is based on the network of operators which prefers maintaining high incentive subgraphs and blockchains. Project Zero will eliminate all these problems by providing a highly available stream of indexed data at a rapid throughput, negligible delay in real-time data update and 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nQuery Engine and Rich APIs: There are no major platforms supporting NEAR but Project Zero differentiates with its modular architecture where adding new tables, blockchains, custom data and scaling new APIs is significantly low effort with high performance. Most of our filters by contract/address on optimized tables give subsecond performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Usage & Examples:**\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is the bespoke data infrastructure for Nexera Exchange, leveraging both historical backfills and real-time data of Ethereum and Arbitrum to their destination tools and platforms for several features. The most popular features are the [price chart](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100) and [order book](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100). Nexera built entire backend modules based on Project Zero data and created several services for volume, price, order status, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNexera Exchange faced several complications in extracting blockchain data at scale for something as simple as price charts on different time frames. They were dependent on several RPCs on very expensive pricing plans, which were also limited due to trace and debug calls. With Project Zero, they can stream historical data in minutes, resulting in immense performance gains, better user experience, and reduced costs. They mainly use \\\\\\\\u{2018}blocks with receipts\\\\\\\\u{2019} and \\\\\\\\u{2018}Logs\\\\\\\\u{2019} from different block numbers across multiple streams. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of Project Zero, Nexera Exchange benefits from faster chain reorg handling (4 blocks per second) on Arbitrum, which existing solutions can\\\\\\\\u{2019}t offer. We reduced recurring infrastructure costs of 15k/month to one-third of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is already empowering and soon empowering (in a few weeks from now) following blockchains Arbitrum, Bitlayer, Scroll, Manta, Polygon, Base, Optimism, Solana and Binance chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Total:**\\\\\\\\n$240,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Breakdown:**\\\\\\\\nThe budget will mainly be used for scaling and maintaining infrastructure and operation costs of the products\\\\\\\\nAdding NEAR blockchain dataset from genesis\\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data\\\\\\\\nOffer free streams of 100GB/month on NEAR\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions (edge computing) for data transformation & filtering\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products like Rich APIs, Query Engine and Super Indexers on NEAR from initial public versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are flexible in the recurring payment period of yearly, quarterly or monthly but with grants support for at least a year.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"projectzero.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"240000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Data Lakes\", \"Indexers\", \"Query API\", \"Other\"]}"

An innovative solution by pushing data to users upon availability. This approach ensures faster, more reliable, and consistent data transmission, fostering trust in the accuracy and timeliness of the data you deliver. Unlike traditional data providers like RPCs or your own node and custom solutions.It efficiently retrieves and delivers transactional data to your preferred destination like S3, Webhook, Kafka etc., ensuring uninterrupted streaming, even during chain reorganizations while maintaining data consistency and with 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions enable to transform streamed data, boosting efficiency and reducing data size by retrieving exactly the data you need, when you need it.

Instead of depending on slow, unreliable subgraphs with a GraphQL interface making it useless when it comes to use at scale. Super Indexers is the solution to all the problems which subgraphs bring along with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Proposal:**\\\\\\\\nThis proposal aims to add support to NEAR blockchains and bring the leading innovative solution by being a bespoke blockchain data infrastructure platform to the NEAR ecosystem. Project Zero has a Data extraction and transformation (Block functions), streaming product that eliminates the burden of handling and managing chain reorgs, data inconsistency, unreliable RPCs which are impractical to use at scale, and extremely costly. Project Zero is stepping into the next phases to solve a-z blockchain data-related problems which includes products like Rich API endpoints, Query Engine and Super Indexers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the current scenario, even with the fractional existing solutions, none of them are supporting NEAR blockchain besides The Graph. The following are the benefits for the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\nHuge incentive for the builders to launch on NEAR with a significantly reduce time to market dApp due to a free plug-and-play data infrastructure\\\\\\\\nNone of the so-called incumbent solutions support NEAR (Alchemy, quicknode, goldsky etc.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the problems we are solving are very fundamental and relevant wherever on-chain data is required, NEAR developer ecosystem (dApps) can reap all the benefits by saving up to 2x time-to-market and saving their previous limited funding by eliminating the need to maintain huge infrastructure and specialized backend developers. As part of the proposal, we would like to provide 100GB/month of free usage of Streaming + Block Functions at no cost of NEAR blockchain data for 12 months from the date of approval of the proposal. Project Zero is a closed source solution with its proprietary technology and algorithms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Goals / Milestones:**\\\\\\\\nAdding Near blockchains dataset from genesis: Q3 2024  \\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data: Always ongoing\\\\\\\\nImplement and provide free usage (100GB/month) of Project Zero data streaming of NEAR blockchain (Launch as soon as Task 1 is finished)\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products on Near: \\\\\\\\nFirst set of Rich APIs (Ex: Token API, Transaction history API etc.): End of Q3 or Start Q4 2024\\\\\\\\nMore sets of Rich APIs (always ongoing): Q4 2024 and beyond for more\\\\\\\\nData Lake and Query Engine on NEAR Blockchain: Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexers v1.0 on NEAR: End of Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24 or Beginning Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\nSupport other types of off chain and chain data like Price feeds etc.: Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe timelines are subjected to the proposal approval date. We are assuming the proposal gets approved well before the end of Q3\\\\\\\\u{2019}24. For the other new products (4-6), we will try to provide some Freemium usage for the NEAR community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Metrics:**\\\\\\\\nThe key success criteria or metrics are:\\\\\\\\nAdoption of Project Zero by NEAR dApps\\\\\\\\nUser retention\\\\\\\\nHigh NPS/CSAT score\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Competitor Comparison:**\\\\\\\\nWe don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t find any 1:1 competitor who is solving all the blockchain data infrastructure problems but we view competitors at specific products level.\\\\\\\\nStreaming & Transformation - Quicknode: Project Zero has an edge with the additional type of chain reorg handling strategy, performance of chain reorg handling, higher throughput and optimized block functions. On a fast blockchain like Arbitrum, Project Zero handles more than 4 blocks per second where the existing solution isn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even close to it!\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexer - The Graph (only major indexer supporting NEAR): Subgraphs on The Graph network lack usability at scale and are highly rate limited with GraphQL endpoints. Moreover the availability and freshness of real-time data isn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t common as the entire model is based on the network of operators which prefers maintaining high incentive subgraphs and blockchains. Project Zero will eliminate all these problems by providing a highly available stream of indexed data at a rapid throughput, negligible delay in real-time data update and 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nQuery Engine and Rich APIs: There are no major platforms supporting NEAR but Project Zero differentiates with its modular architecture where adding new tables, blockchains, custom data and scaling new APIs is significantly low effort with high performance. Most of our filters by contract/address on optimized tables give subsecond performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Usage & Examples:**\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is the bespoke data infrastructure for Nexera Exchange, leveraging both historical backfills and real-time data of Ethereum and Arbitrum to their destination tools and platforms for several features. The most popular features are the [price chart](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100) and [order book](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100). Nexera built entire backend modules based on Project Zero data and created several services for volume, price, order status, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNexera Exchange faced several complications in extracting blockchain data at scale for something as simple as price charts on different time frames. They were dependent on several RPCs on very expensive pricing plans, which were also limited due to trace and debug calls. With Project Zero, they can stream historical data in minutes, resulting in immense performance gains, better user experience, and reduced costs. They mainly use \\\\\\\\u{2018}blocks with receipts\\\\\\\\u{2019} and \\\\\\\\u{2018}Logs\\\\\\\\u{2019} from different block numbers across multiple streams. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of Project Zero, Nexera Exchange benefits from faster chain reorg handling (4 blocks per second) on Arbitrum, which existing solutions can\\\\\\\\u{2019}t offer. We reduced recurring infrastructure costs of 15k/month to one-third of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is already empowering and soon empowering (in a few weeks from now) following blockchains Arbitrum, Bitlayer, Scroll, Manta, Polygon, Base, Optimism, Solana and Binance chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Total:**\\\\\\\\n$240,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Breakdown:**\\\\\\\\nThe budget will mainly be used for scaling and maintaining infrastructure and operation costs of the products\\\\\\\\nAdding NEAR blockchain dataset from genesis\\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data\\\\\\\\nOffer free streams of 100GB/month on NEAR\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions (edge computing) for data transformation & filtering\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products like Rich APIs, Query Engine and Super Indexers on NEAR from initial public versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are flexible in the recurring payment period of yearly, quarterly or monthly but with grants support for at least a year.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"projectzero.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"240000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"e4501c42a79df3ac05cfe7bd9f94e946a0a430fab8fbf09556e1856c724cda97\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

Most of our filters by contract/address on optimized tables give subsecond performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Usage & Examples:**\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is the bespoke data infrastructure for Nexera Exchange, leveraging both historical backfills and real-time data of Ethereum and Arbitrum to their destination tools and platforms for several features. The most popular features are the [price chart](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100) and [order book](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100). Nexera built entire backend modules based on Project Zero data and created several services for volume, price, order status, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNexera Exchange faced several complications in extracting blockchain data at scale for something as simple as price charts on different time frames. They were dependent on several RPCs on very expensive pricing plans, which were also limited due to trace and debug calls. With Project Zero, they can stream historical data in minutes, resulting in immense performance gains, better user experience, and reduced costs. They mainly use \\\\\\\\u{2018}blocks with receipts\\\\\\\\u{2019} and \\\\\\\\u{2018}Logs\\\\\\\\u{2019} from different block numbers across multiple streams. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of Project Zero, Nexera Exchange benefits from faster chain reorg handling (4 blocks per second) on Arbitrum, which existing solutions can\\\\\\\\u{2019}t offer. We reduced recurring infrastructure costs of 15k/month to one-third of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is already empowering and soon empowering (in a few weeks from now) following blockchains Arbitrum, Bitlayer, Scroll, Manta, Polygon, Base, Optimism, Solana and Binance chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Total:**\\\\\\\\n$240,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Breakdown:**\\\\\\\\nThe budget will mainly be used for scaling and maintaining infrastructure and operation costs of the products\\\\\\\\nAdding NEAR blockchain dataset from genesis\\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data\\\\\\\\nOffer free streams of 100GB/month on NEAR\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions (edge computing) for data transformation & filtering\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products like Rich APIs, Query Engine and Super Indexers on NEAR from initial public versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are flexible in the recurring payment period of yearly, quarterly or monthly but with grants support for at least a year.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"projectzero.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"240000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\", \"Indexers\", \"Query API\", \"Data Lakes\"]}"
