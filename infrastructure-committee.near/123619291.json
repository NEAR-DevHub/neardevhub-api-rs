This will allow us to keep supporting NEAR while continuing our discussion with the Infra Committee about the long-term vision for NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#Budget - 9,000 NEAR#\\\\\\\\nOut of good faith, Lava is waiving its operation fees for this period, so the entire budget will be used to attract and incentivize data providers on Lava.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"83735a70a618fdfa345d26d2ceec830f403ae742a5244bcbd728d97dd8e782fd\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"56000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"author_id\": \"f63d2dbe387b41b94499ccf4d14c49d3b0e1316744dc98a2c3e0cf2c23710ecf\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

Vertical slicing in agile breakdown refers to the practice of dividing work into thin, end-to-end slices that cut through all layers of the system to deliver a complete, functional piece of user value. Each vertical slice represents a small, independent feature or a user story that can be implemented, tested, and delivered to users.\\\\\\\\nHere are the key points about vertical slicing:\\\\\\\\n- Each vertical slice encompasses all necessary components (e.g., user interface, business logic, database interactions) to deliver a fully functional feature.\\\\\\\\n- The primary goal is to deliver tangible user value with each increment. This approach ensures that every slice results in a usable piece of software.\\\\\\\\n- Vertical slicing aligns with agile principles of incremental and iterative development, enabling us to deliver small, manageable pieces of functionality frequently.\\\\\\\\n- Vertical slicing encourages collaboration among team members with different expertise (e.g., frontend, backend, QA) to ensure that each slice is fully functional and integrated.\\\\\\\\n- By delivering complete features frequently, we can gather user feedback early and often, allowing for quicker adjustments and improvements.\\\\\\\\n- Since each vertical slice is a self-contained feature, integration issues are minimized compared to horizontal slicing, where different components must be integrated later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe utilize an Agile approach with standard ceremonies (stand-up, grooming, refinement, review, retro). We will have 2-weeks sprints and we welcome Committee representatives to participate in our backlog management routines or review if needed. We aim to deliver tangible value each sprint and a practical piece of the end-to-end journey for each milestone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe use Figma for the design. Reference for the style that will be used can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/Gaa51AGWBRTyKXF6TE2sjY/Astra%2B%2B-(Mobile)?node-id=0-1&t=CJlkI50FetgIrHtV-0).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Solution overview\\\\\\\\nThe solution has four architectural components:\\\\\\\\n- Stable Sputnik DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- DAO contract created through the Sputnik DAO contract (%dao_name%.sputnik\\\\\\\\u{2026})\\\\\\\\n- BOS UI\\\\\\\\n- Open-source js backend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBOS UI features:\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-1]** Mobile first with adaptive design for the desktop\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-2]** Wizard to create/disable DAO (new UX and implementation). Default user flow will create a DAO with 2 pre-set groups - Council and Members.\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-3]** UI to define legislative proposal routines. \\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.1]** Add/delete member to the group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.2]** Add/delete group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.3]** Add/delete funding threshold (e.g. if we have 10000, 50000, 10000 we can configure different quorum requirements for intervals 0-10000, 10000-50000, 50000-100000). A quorum requirement can be set for each group and using \\\\\\\\u{201c}AND\\\\\\\\u{201d} or \\\\\\\\u{201c}OR\\\\\\\\u{201d} logical operations e.g. need 60% councils AND 50% members.\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.4]** Add quorum requirement per group/funding threshold\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-4]** UI to browse through legislative proposals with full data available on who voted how on each proposal\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-5]** UI to vote on proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDAO contract features:\\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-1]** Support data structures for DAO management features \\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-2]** Support view methods for the list of proposals \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJS Backend features:\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-1]** Fetch and process data from DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-2]** Cache data for the BOS UI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why should the committee choose this project?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project is in line with the Committee\\\\\\\\\\\\'s priorities and our team has a proven background of delivering solutions in NEAR with similar architecture.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, MIT licensing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe whole project will take three months with monthly milestones\\\\\\\\n- Basic features (**BOS-2,BOS-3.1,BOS-3.2**)\\\\\\\\n- DAO management features (**BOS-3.3, BOS-3.4**)\\\\\\\\n- Browsing and voting (**BOS-4, BOS-5**)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How will we measure success \\\\\\\\nDelivery of end-to-end journeys described in the Goals/Milestone section. We don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have business metrics - only technical definitions of done which include code being available on GitHub under the MIT license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresented functionality is available in Astra++.  We outline several issues which were part of the motivation for the current proposal: \\\\\\\\n- Lack of ownership and absence of long-term vision-strategy for the products. The outcome is that the product becomes a pile of features (like a pizza - similar to what we have in \\\\\\\\u{201c}pizza coding\\\\\\\\u{201d} when developers just pile their code on top of the previous developers without having a single owner and without understanding of the approach that was taken by the previous developer).\\\\\\\\n- Dependency on closed-sourced indexers. Core contracts lacking view methods and data about DAOs is retrieved through an indexer developed by a 3-d party which is a closed source. Indexers in general are very unreliable and are the source of errors. For example, even a mature and well-recognized NEAR indexer built by Pagoda contains data errors which we found during our work - indexers are complicated in NEAR in general and wherever there is a complicated component there is room for an error. Moreover, architecture with indexers hinders scalability drastically, especially closed-sourced indexers.\\\\\\\\n- Lack of UX design - the product looks like a product for developers by developers which raises the entry barrier and results in the creation of DAOs only just to create a formal structure for funds funneling - the interface is not engaging people into the decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe offer to restructure DAO management tools in a completely open sourced fashion with usage of native view methods instead of indexers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$97,500 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Engineering salaries - 81500 USD for 3 months of development. 1 month of full support is included.\\\\\\\\n- Management salaries - 15000 USD for 3 months\\\\\\\\n- Infra/tooling (servers lease, gas costs) - 1000USD\\\\\\\\nTotal - $97,500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Future plans\\\\\\\\nThis proposal addresses the first of the identified gaps in the current user experience in interacting with Sputnik-DAO contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur future plans include the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Incorporate 3rd party applications to provide the functionality to handle general and decision-specific discussions in DAOs. This can be achieved by integrating with Social DB or with centralized applications (e.g. Discord, Zulip, Mattermost, Telegram). This integration requires additional research to provide a holistic approach that would be compatible with other applications that cover different functionality over the Sputnik-DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- Provide a reporting tool that would allow users to generate comprehensive, human-readable reports on funding, payments, and decision making. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth of the points above will be addressed in individual proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"24a2788251373b64d58200665f12b00cfb2d6c9d2dc79b209d39cd0e433f5b3f\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"97500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\"]}"

Chains create incentive pools which attract providers to  serve in-demand infrastructure services, which are added as modules called specifications (\\\\\\\\u{2019}Specs\\\\\\\\u{2019}). RPC and Archive data is the network\\\\\\\\u{2019}s initial service, with advanced APIs, indexers, sequencers, oracles and more planned to be added soon.\\\\\\\\nLava is not an RPC provider! We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re an open protocol that creates a reliable and decentralized RPC layer for NEAR, by aggregating top providers into a single endpoint, where user requests are routed to the top-performing providers in their geolocation. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve developed a novel P2P mechanism that removes Lava as a single point of failure;if there is an available NEAR RPC provider on Lava, users will be able to communicate with it.\\\\\\\\n#Organization#\\\\\\\\nLava Foundation is a non-profit entity representing Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s token holders and DAO, leading the vision and development of Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s protocol and network. Our specialized team offers vast experience in Web3 strategy, growth, marketing, leading the vision and blockchain development. The Foundation collaborates with Magma Devs, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s initial core contributor - a team world class builders and ex-founders.\\\\\\\\n[Amir Aaronosn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-aaronson/) - Head of Lava Foundation\\\\\\\\nAmir has extensive experience in strategic oversight and innovation in technology enterprises. He has been active in the blockchain space since 2017 and up until recently served as the head of the foundation at Beam\\\\\\\\n[Omer Mishael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omer-mishael) - CTO at Lava Foundation\\\\\\\\nOmer is a specialized expert in RPC, consensus building, Layer 1 protocols, software design, and development.\\\\\\\\n[Ethan Luc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-luc/) - Head of Marketing at Lava Foundation\\\\\\\\nEthan has previously managed the digital growth of hundreds of small and medium companies spending millions in quarterly marketing spend, and advised multiple blockchain startups on their go-to-market. Prior to Lava, he was building an NFT marketplace using social graphs for community discovery.\\\\\\\\n[Yuval Binder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuval-binder/), BD Lead at Magma Devs - Main POC\\\\\\\\n##Lava-NEAR-Affiliation and Professional Experience##\\\\\\\\nSince starting our collaboration with NEAR in June of last year, and launching our services in February, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been working closely with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda to improve our offering and fine tune it to users\\\\\\\\u{2019} needs.\\\\\\\\nOur users include some of the largest dapps and wallets in the ecosystem as well as a large community of independent teams, developers and users. Since we launched users have been consistently reporting a significant improvement in performance once they start using Lava.\\\\\\\\nSo far:\\\\\\\\n- 10B+ RPC requests served\\\\\\\\n- Supporting users on Ref Finance, Mintbase, Keypom, ShardDog, Sender, Here, Potlock, MyNearWallet and more\\\\\\\\n- Onboarded 53 RPC providers including KJ Nodes, Node Fleet, Stakecito, Pathrocknetwork, Decentrio\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#User & Provider Testimonials:#\\\\\\\\nRef Finance: \\\\\\\\u{201d}Lava is a critical partner for Ref Finance. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using their public endpoint as one of the official RPCs for our product, and have been very happy with their performance and stability.\\\\\\\\nDuring our collaboration with Lava, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been working closely with their team, who\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been constantly improving & customizing their service to fit our needs.\\\\\\\\nWe look forward to grow our RPC partnership with Lava!\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\nMintbase/Bitte: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve noticed a significant improvement in the reliability and smoothness of Mintbase Wallet.\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s team went above and beyond, instantly jumping in to assist whenever we found issues.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nShardDog: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack. As usage grows but we stay as a small team, we need reliable infra to handle the scaling. Since adding this to our front-end and back-end APIs, it has allowed us to focus on improving our product instead of the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nLiquify: \\\\\\\\u{201c}Liquify is excited to support Lava in building out a scalable and robust decentralized RPC infra. Utilizing Liquify\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bare metal and geo-diverse locations, we are strongly aligned to make sure that their is always optimal nodes for the network to rely on globally.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\nPathrocknetwork (RPC Provider): \\\\\\\\u{201c}Working with Lava has been a great experience right from the start. The rewards we earned for running NEAR RPC are extremely helpful to maintaining and improving our operations. We highly value Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s tech and expertise, and look forward to continued collaboration.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n#Portfolio of relevant work:#\\\\\\\\nLava holds an impressive portfolio of RPC partnerships with leading blockchains and rollups, including NEAR, Axelar, Evmos, Starknet and Koii who are already live, and Filecoin, Cosmos, Stargaze, Union coming soon on Mainnet.\\\\\\\\nLearn more:\\\\\\\\n[Incentivized Public RPC on NEAR](https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz/status/1747653696476099017)\\\\\\\\n[30,000$ worth of monthly token incentives](https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz/status/1768703687873134706)\\\\\\\\n[Incentivized Public RPC is coming to Union](https://twitter.com/union_build/status/1777374142763057562)\\\\\\\\n#Proposal#\\\\\\\\nNEAR is on an exciting growth trajectory, and that directly translates into increasing loads on its infrastructure, making it essential to continuously enhance our public infrastructure.\\\\\\\\nOur goal in the coming year is to make Lava the go-to RPC for NEAR, and redistribute RPC requests in the ecosystem across a large number of providers. Aggregating top providers on Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public endpoint will not only decentralize the infrastructure, but also improve UX and cost efficiency for NF, dapps, and end users.\\\\\\\\nWe ask for bridge funding to extend our existing grant from NEAR Foundation for another 3 months.

We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using their public endpoint as one of the official RPCs for our product, and have been very happy with their performance and stability.\\\\\\\\nDuring our collaboration with Lava, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been working closely with their team, who\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been constantly improving & customizing their service to fit our needs.\\\\\\\\nWe look forward to grow our RPC partnership with Lava!\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\nMintbase/Bitte: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve noticed a significant improvement in the reliability and smoothness of Mintbase Wallet.\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s team went above and beyond, instantly jumping in to assist whenever we found issues.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nShardDog: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack. As usage grows but we stay as a small team, we need reliable infra to handle the scaling. Since adding this to our front-end and back-end APIs, it has allowed us to focus on improving our product instead of the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nLiquify: \\\\\\\\u{201c}Liquify is excited to support Lava in building out a scalable and robust decentralized RPC infra. Utilizing Liquify\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bare metal and geo-diverse locations, we are strongly aligned to make sure that their is always optimal nodes for the network to rely on globally.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\nPathrocknetwork (RPC Provider): \\\\\\\\u{201c}Working with Lava has been a great experience right from the start. The rewards we earned for running NEAR RPC are extremely helpful to maintaining and improving our operations. We highly value Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s tech and expertise, and look forward to continued collaboration.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n#Portfolio of relevant work:#\\\\\\\\nLava holds an impressive portfolio of RPC partnerships with leading blockchains and rollups, including NEAR, Axelar, Evmos, Starknet and Koii who are already live, and Filecoin, Cosmos, Stargaze, Union coming soon on Mainnet.\\\\\\\\nLearn more:\\\\\\\\n[Incentivized Public RPC on NEAR](https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz/status/1747653696476099017)\\\\\\\\n[30,000$ worth of monthly token incentives](https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz/status/1768703687873134706)\\\\\\\\n[Incentivized Public RPC is coming to Union](https://twitter.com/union_build/status/1777374142763057562)\\\\\\\\n#Proposal#\\\\\\\\nNEAR is on an exciting growth trajectory, and that directly translates into increasing loads on its infrastructure, making it essential to continuously enhance our public infrastructure.\\\\\\\\nOur goal in the coming year is to make Lava the go-to RPC for NEAR, and redistribute RPC requests in the ecosystem across a large number of providers. Aggregating top providers on Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public endpoint will not only decentralize the infrastructure, but also improve UX and cost efficiency for NF, dapps, and end users.\\\\\\\\nWe ask for bridge funding to extend our existing grant from NEAR Foundation for another 3 months. This will allow us to keep supporting NEAR while continuing our discussion with the Infra Committee about the long-term vision for NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#Budget - 9,000 NEAR#\\\\\\\\nOut of good faith, Lava is waiving its operation fees for this period, so the entire budget will be used to attract and incentivize data providers on Lava.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"83735a70a618fdfa345d26d2ceec830f403ae742a5244bcbd728d97dd8e782fd\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"56000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\"]}"

He has been in the blockchain industry for 3+ years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNikita Grechino (Co-Founder) is a full-stack engineer with more than 6 years of experience. He has been working in the blockchain space since early 2022, focusing on the development of the front-end interface for crypto trading platforms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeorge Vosorov is an Integration Engineer at Chainspect, specializing in ETL and data warehouse development. He previously worked as a Data Engineer at Unilever, focusing on data pipelines.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\nNo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\nSee Team background and bios section\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\nYes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign, UX/UI: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject management: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer support: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBD / Marketing: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (The primary approach and solution of the proposal.)\\\\\\\\nChainspect (https://chainspect.app/) stands as a dedicated blockchain analytics platform, emphasizing technical metrics. As the leading TPS Tracker on the market, we aim to evolve into the foremost platform for fundamental blockchain analysis. Currently, we serve over 10,000 crypto investors and dApp developers monthly and cover 40+ of the most widely used blockchains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of it as CoinMarketCap, but instead focused on fundamental analysis and not price talks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nChainspect is the biggest TPS Tracker on the market, used by thousands of crypto investors and dApp developers monthly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur team has extensive experience with diverse chains, including EVM/Substrate ones. Chainspect manages the integration entirely, requiring only a reliable endpoint to connect to your network and information on system/voting transactions. This approach ensures the inclusion of valid transactions, fostering fair comparisons between blockchains. For instance, in the case of Solana, we exclude \\\\\\\\u{201c}voting\\\\\\\\u{201d} transactions tied to their custom consensus mechanism. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have already collaborated with chains such as BNB Chain, Fantom, Starknet, Sei, Stellar, Aptos, Hedera, Telos, and many others.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?)\\\\\\\\nNo, all code is private, but we do plan to release a public API to fetch our data in the future\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nThis proposal covers the integration of the NEAR blockchain into the Chainspect analytics platform, along with ongoing support and development to maintain NEAR as a listed chain for one year.\\\\\\\\nThe Chainspect team will handle the entire integration process, needing only a reliable endpoint to connect to your network and information on the system and voting transactions.\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR metrics displayed on the dashboard will include:\\\\\\\\n1. Realtime TPS (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)\\\\\\\\n2. Max Recorded TPS\\\\\\\\n3. Max Theoretical TPS\\\\\\\\n4. Time To Finality\\\\\\\\n5. Block Time\\\\\\\\n6. Governance Type\\\\\\\\n7. Launch Date\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe completed integration will include NEAR as part of Chainspect with all seven metrics described earlier. NEAR will receive continuous updates as Chainspect adds new metrics or UI improvements.\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR team will have the option to provide feedback on NEAR-related metrics and descriptions, which the Chainspect team will consider.\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, upon successful integration, Chainspect and NEAR can make a joint announcement on X/Discord and other platforms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, there are no other TPS trackers on the market that monitor 40+ blockchain networks 24/7 while standardizing metrics across different architectures and consensus mechanisms. Our closest competitors are blockchain media sources that occasionally publish blog posts on TPS and compare various networks. However, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve observed that many of these media sources have started to use Chainspect as their primary data source, positioning Chainspect as the industry standard for TPS calculations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe annual fee for this proposal is $5800, preferably paid in USDT or USDC. This proposal includes only one milestone.\\\\\\\\nThe budget will cover development costs for the integration, research efforts to accurately calculate static metrics based on NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s architecture and technology, and ongoing hardware and labor costs to keep NEAR listed on Chainspect.\\\\\\\\nThis fee also ensures NEAR will continuously receive the latest metrics integrated into Chainspect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnnual fee of $5800 (preferably paid in USDT/USDC).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport and Development costs - $4000\\\\\\\\nOngoing technical support, software updates, and new feature development to ensure optimal performance and continuous improvement of NEAR metrics on the Chainspect platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware and infra costs - $1800\\\\\\\\nMaintenance of existing hardware/software and other infrastructure-related costs, related to keeping NEAR as one of the listed chains on Chainspect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"stillemail8340.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"5800\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Indexers\", \"Other\"]}"
