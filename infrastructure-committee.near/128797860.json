There is an urgent need to transition the management and development of NEAR Lake and its associated libraries to a capable service provider, ensuring no downtime and a smooth transition within three months.\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"ACCEPTING_SUBMISSIONS\"}, \"description\": \"## Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake is an indexer built on top of the [NEAR Indexer microframework](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/tree/master/chain/indexer). It watches the network and stores all events as JSON files on AWS S3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake and its S3 bucket are the default data sources for NEAR Lake Framework, an ecosystem of library companions to [NEAR Lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake). The framework allows you to build your indexer that subscribes to the stream of blocks from the [NEAR Lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake) data source and create your logic to process the NEAR Protocol data in the programming languages of your choice (at the moment, there are implementations in [Python](http://pypi.org/project/near-lake-framework), [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-lake-framework), and [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/near-lake-framework)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelevant resources:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Indexer [https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer/](https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer/) is a wrapper around [nearcore](https://github.com/near/nearcore) (NEAR node) that the NEAR Lake team maintains to dump the blocks/chunks from the chain to S3. The [near-lake-framework-](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework)* repos are clients of this data source.\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Framework [https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework)\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Framework RS [https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs)\\\\\\\\n* Using NEAR Lake ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsF7I93K-EQ)) [https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite its relatively low maintenance complexity, NEAR Lake is a critical piece of infrastructure that supports a majority of key stakeholders within the NEAR Ecosystem, resulting in high usage. [With Pagoda winding down its services](https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-08-13-pagoda-services), there is an urgent need to transition the management and development of NEAR Lake and its associated libraries to a capable service provider, ensuring no downtime and a smooth transition within three months. The transition may involve the new provider setting up new storage (S3) and migrating users to the new bucket or taking over the existing S3 currently managed by the Pagoda team. Please note that with protocol upgrades like dynamic sharding, the complexity of NEAR Lake will also increase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Technical Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake is built as an unstructured [AWS data lake](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/datalakes/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo AWS S3 buckets must be created:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* near-lake-data-testnet (eu-central-1 region)\\\\\\\\n* near-lake-data-mainnet (eu-central-1 region)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequired to be maintained as part of this RFP;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The two previously listed S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n* Two RPC nodes per network with an indexer framework enabled. These nodes populate data in the AWS S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe source code can be found here: [https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer](https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should include plans for:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Maintaining these S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n* Maintaining lake indexer nodes or another way of populating the S3 buckets with the same data set and low latency.\\\\\\\\n* Outlining strategies to reduce costs given the current infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Storage & Growth\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should take into account the current size and potential growth of storage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Current Size:** ~40 TB\\\\\\\\n* **Previous Growth:** 4.2 TB Monthly. As usage increases the monthly growth is projected to increase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake Framework is critical infrastructure powering all our data systems, including 50 monthly AWS accounts running Indexers on NEAR Lake. These users collectively generate more than a thousand requests per second. Examples of S3 file consumers include NEAR One [ReadRPC](https://github.com/near/read-rpc), Ecosystem Indexers supporting dApps, and Data Warehouses like Databricks and Flipside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![near_lake_image_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a543d77d-f647-4bb1-b02d-e5ed8a2113c3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Service Level Agreement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Transaction Throughput: The system must support at least 1,000 transactions per second to handle peak loads efficiently.\\\\\\\\n* Lag from the final block: The last available block in the NEAR Lake must be less than five blocks behind the last finalized block on NEAR RPC.\\\\\\\\n* Scalability: The solution must demonstrate the ability to scale linearly with increased data volumes, supporting up to 10 times the initial load without performance degradation.\\\\\\\\n* Uptime: The service must maintain an uptime of 99.9% for mainnet, which will be specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\\\\\\\\n* Status Page: A public status page, similar to the Google Cloud Service Health page, must be maintained to inform users of the service status, including uptime, incidents, and maintenance updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition Steps\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Review and understand NEAR Lake.\\\\\\\\n2. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team to AWS S3 buckets and accompanying repos. Transition AWS S3 bucket ownership (or move to new buckets) and set up new indexing nodes.\\\\\\\\n3. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda continuity team.\\\\\\\\n4. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n5. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n6. Update all relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n7. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n8. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee & Pagoda Continuity time.\\\\\\\\n9. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders (Users of Lake, NEAR One, etc.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should outline a detailed budget with a clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance and support, infrastructure, third-party services, and external API costs. Maintenance costs should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Properly assessing a budget based on usage is a significant factor in qualifying legitimate entities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease highlight the details of the various milestones in your development plan and the relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around the milestone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s success (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include signing the agreement, the official transition, a 6-month or 12-month billing period, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Contingency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclude a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. Suppose expenses for providing free services or public goods to the NEAR ecosystem exceed previous budgets. In that case, a clear policy should be to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Experience Required\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven this component\\\\\\\\\\\\'s critical role in the NEAR infrastructure, we seek an infrastructure provider already deeply embedded in the ecosystem (e.g., currently operating a NEAR indexer or a former Pagoda SRE). They must have substantial experience and commitment to the platform. Furthermore, due to the close integration of NEAR Lake with services such as the Kit Wallet Indexer API and the BigQuery dataset, we recommend that the same provider also manage and extend these related infrastructure components.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:**Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:**Your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building this infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Boilerplate)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TVvPXPJhZfaFwfA2UMW6c3pO2kis45SJ1Np1XOkkhnA/edit?usp=sharing) is a standard (+ [markup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing)) template you can use as a starting point.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMarketing materials, presentations, and images can be attached as needed as external links. An easy way to do this is to start a discussion under the Proposals category on the Infrastructure Working Group GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/categories/proposals), publish, edit the post, and finally copy the links generated for the files you uploaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Proposal Submission Dates\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe deadline for proposal submission is **Tuesday, October 8th** (giving applicants approximately two weeks), with a Q&A period on the proposal itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Selection Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter reviewing the proposals, the committee will vote on the best one. Generally, this process takes two working weeks to complete and will be discussed and voted on at the regular bi-weekly meeting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Voting Dates\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe estimate for voting completion is **two weeks** after the proposal submission date.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe estimated transition time is one week, not considering any KYC or KYB blockers.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Funding Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee governs funding with assistance from the NEAR Foundation. If selected, your proposal enters the funding pipeline. You are required to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Complete the KYC/B process conducted by the NEAR Foundation, including verification by IDVerify.\\\\\\\\n* Sign a legal agreement regarding the work as outlined in the proposal conducted by the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n* Submit an invoice to NEAR Foundation Finance outlining how you want funds disbursed, to what wallets or banks, and in the agreed-upon amounts.\\\\\\\\n* Complete a test transaction to verify target wallets (when requesting funds in cryptocurrency).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Funding Dates\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe funding process is generally completed in one working week if the proposal does not require clarifications in the budget, work approach, legal agreement, or invoicing terms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Communication\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease direct all communications to the thread where the RFP started beneath the submitted proposal. Please direct confidential or sensitive communications to the Telegram group set up between the committee and the organization/entity/team.

There is an urgent need to transition the management and development of NEAR Lake and its associated libraries to a capable service provider, ensuring no downtime and a smooth transition within three months.\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"ACCEPTING_SUBMISSIONS\"}, \"description\": \"## Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake is an indexer built on top of the [NEAR Indexer microframework](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/tree/master/chain/indexer). It watches the network and stores all events as JSON files on AWS S3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake and its S3 bucket are the default data sources for NEAR Lake Framework, an ecosystem of library companions to [NEAR Lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake). The framework allows you to build your indexer that subscribes to the stream of blocks from the [NEAR Lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake) data source and create your logic to process the NEAR Protocol data in the programming languages of your choice (at the moment, there are implementations in [Python](http://pypi.org/project/near-lake-framework), [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-lake-framework), and [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/near-lake-framework)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelevant resources:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Indexer [https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer/](https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer/) is a wrapper around [nearcore](https://github.com/near/nearcore) (NEAR node) that the NEAR Lake team maintains to dump the blocks/chunks from the chain to S3. The [near-lake-framework-](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework)* repos are clients of this data source.\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Framework [https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework)\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Lake Framework RS [https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs)\\\\\\\\n* Using NEAR Lake ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsF7I93K-EQ)) [https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite its relatively low maintenance complexity, NEAR Lake is a critical piece of infrastructure that supports a majority of key stakeholders within the NEAR Ecosystem, resulting in high usage. [With Pagoda winding down its services](https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-08-13-pagoda-services), there is an urgent need to transition the management and development of NEAR Lake and its associated libraries to a capable service provider, ensuring no downtime and a smooth transition within three months. The transition may involve the new provider setting up new storage (S3) and migrating users to the new bucket or taking over the existing S3 currently managed by the Pagoda team. Please note that with protocol upgrades like dynamic sharding, the complexity of NEAR Lake will also increase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Technical Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake is built as an unstructured [AWS data lake](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/datalakes/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo AWS S3 buckets must be created:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* near-lake-data-testnet (eu-central-1 region)\\\\\\\\n* near-lake-data-mainnet (eu-central-1 region)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequired to be maintained as part of this RFP;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The two previously listed S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n* Two RPC nodes per network with an indexer framework enabled. These nodes populate data in the AWS S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe source code can be found here: [https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer](https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should include plans for:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Maintaining these S3 buckets.\\\\\\\\n* Maintaining lake indexer nodes or another way of populating the S3 buckets with the same data set and low latency.\\\\\\\\n* Outlining strategies to reduce costs given the current infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Storage & Growth\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should take into account the current size and potential growth of storage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Current Size:** ~40 TB\\\\\\\\n* **Previous Growth:** 4.2 TB Monthly. As usage increases, the monthly growth is projected to increase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR Lake Framework is critical infrastructure powering all our data systems, including 50 monthly AWS accounts running Indexers on NEAR Lake. These users collectively generate more than a thousand requests per second. Examples of S3 file consumers include NEAR One [ReadRPC](https://github.com/near/read-rpc), Ecosystem Indexers supporting dApps, and Data Warehouses like Databricks and Flipside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![near_lake_image_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a543d77d-f647-4bb1-b02d-e5ed8a2113c3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Service Level Agreement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Transaction Throughput: The system must support at least 1,000 transactions per second to handle peak loads efficiently.\\\\\\\\n* Lag from the final block: The last available block in the NEAR Lake must be less than five blocks behind the last finalized block on NEAR RPC.\\\\\\\\n* Scalability: The solution must demonstrate the ability to scale linearly with increased data volumes, supporting up to 10 times the initial load without performance degradation.\\\\\\\\n* Uptime: The service must maintain an uptime of 99.9% for mainnet, which will be specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\\\\\\\\n* Status Page: A public status page, similar to the Google Cloud Service Health page, must be maintained to inform users of the service status, including uptime, incidents, and maintenance updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition Steps\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Review and understand NEAR Lake.\\\\\\\\n2. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team to AWS S3 buckets and accompanying repos. Transition AWS S3 bucket ownership (or move to new buckets) and set up new indexing nodes.\\\\\\\\n3. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda continuity team.\\\\\\\\n4. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n5. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n6. Update all relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n7. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n8. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee & Pagoda Continuity time.\\\\\\\\n9. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders (Users of Lake, NEAR One, etc.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should outline a detailed budget with a clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance and support, infrastructure, third-party services, and external API costs. Maintenance costs should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Properly assessing a budget based on usage is a significant factor in qualifying legitimate entities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease highlight the details of the various milestones in your development plan and the relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around the milestone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s success (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include signing the agreement, the official transition, a 6-month or 12-month billing period, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Contingency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclude a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. Suppose expenses for providing free services or public goods to the NEAR ecosystem exceed previous budgets. In that case, a clear policy should be to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Experience Required\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven this component\\\\\\\\\\\\'s critical role in the NEAR infrastructure, we seek an infrastructure provider already deeply embedded in the ecosystem (e.g., currently operating a NEAR indexer or a former Pagoda SRE). They must have substantial experience and commitment to the platform. Furthermore, due to the close integration of NEAR Lake with services such as the Kit Wallet Indexer API and the BigQuery dataset, we recommend that the same provider also manage and extend these related infrastructure components.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:**Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:**Your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building this infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Boilerplate)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

There are two common types of nodes:\\\\\\\\n- RPC nodes (as well as validator nodes)\\\\\\\\n- Archive nodes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRPC nodes keep track of all headers and the last N epochs of blocks data. RPC nodes usually require fast NVME SSD disk(s) to keep all data in order to be able to keep up with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArchive nodes keep track of all headers and all blocks data. Archive nodes split state into hot-data and cold-data. The hot-data requires an NVME SSD disk, while cold-data can be kept on the HDDs array. Note, that an archive node with hdd version is not practical for quick RPC queries against older data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo synchronize a nearcore node, the operator usually uses a data snapshot from another synchronized nearcore node and then catches up with the head of the network. This process is much faster than synchronizing the blockchain from the beginning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal is focusing on providing snapshots to the community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Previous state\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, the snapshots were provided by Pagoda and were served from AWS S3 and/or Cloudfront. S3 has a per GB egress cost associated with downloads. Cloudfront price depends on total monthly usage and varies from $30 to $120 per TB, and since regular RPC snapshots are around 1.6 TB, the cost of every RPC download may result in $150.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA mainnet archive snapshot, contains about 62Tb of data. So a single download at $60 per TB costs $3,720.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe storage on S3 is around $22 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the nodes are operated in the AWS, then upload to S3 is free, but if the nodes are hosted outside (e.g. on GCP), then there is a cost associated with uploading data, which for GCP may be around $45 to $90 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the current monthly size of S3 bucket to be around 500-700TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe egress costs may be the highest contributing factor! The egress also increases during resharding events and protocol upgrades (e.g. `2.0.0` release), when some validators fail to upgrade and are forced to sync from the snapshots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the previous infrastructure cost to be from $30,000 to $90,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Solution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s solution is to leverage Cloudflare\\\\\\\\u{2019}s R2 instead of S3, which has no associated egress cost, but instead it is charged based on amount of data stored and number of times each file is accessed. R2 also has lower storage cost per GB than AWS S3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- R2 storage cost per TB is $15 per month.\\\\\\\\n- R2 write costs are $4.5 per 1,000,000 Operations A (usually write, list, etc.)\\\\\\\\n- R2 access cost is $0.36 per 1,000,000 Operations B (which includes read and head requests).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince R2 doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t provide a public S3 endpoint, the snapshots will be accessible through HTTPS using a list of snapshot files in a separate file. It can be downloaded using `rclone` in parallel using one of the provided script, e.g. https://github.com/fastnear/static/blob/main/down_rclone.sh\\\\\\\\nThis setup supports downloading snapshot\\\\\\\\u{2019}s data at high bandwidth by leveraging Cloudflare caching and edge network.\\\\\\\\nWe plan to add md5 verification to verify files integrity and automatically retry downloads for malformed files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Snapshot process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe leverage BTRFS to be able to create a just-in-time snapshot of a storage on the node to decrease downtime of the node. On our proof-of-concept we were able to achieve close to 10Gbps upload speed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimplified process:\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the node\\\\\\\\n2. Snapshot the data using BTRFS\\\\\\\\n3. Start the node\\\\\\\\n4. Generate the file list and md5 hashes\\\\\\\\n5. Upload files to R2\\\\\\\\n6. Upload the file list\\\\\\\\n7. Update list of available snapshots\\\\\\\\n8. Update the latest available snapshot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Snapshots\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR to provide snapshots at the following frequency:\\\\\\\\n- RPC for both mainnet and testnet:\\\\\\\\n    - 1 snapshot with 5 epochs per day with the retention of 30 days\\\\\\\\n    - (Mainnet only) 3 snapshots with 3 epochs per day with the retention of 2 days \\\\\\\\n- Archive for both mainnet and testnet:\\\\\\\\n    - 1 hot-data per day with the retention of 30 days\\\\\\\\n    - 1 cold-data per **week** with the retention of 30 days (about 4 snapshots per month)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Sizing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Mainnet snapshots:\\\\\\\\n    - RPC/Hot-data with 5 epochs: 1.7Tb\\\\\\\\n    - RPC with 3 epochs: 1.3Tb\\\\\\\\n    - Cold-data: 60Tb\\\\\\\\n- Testnet snapshots:\\\\\\\\n    - RPC/Hot-data with 5 epochs: 0.6Tb\\\\\\\\n    - Cold-data: 11Tb\\\\\\\\n- Expected growth: 6% per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent Total: ~432Tb / month\\\\\\\\nFile count: ~8,863,744 files per month (based on 64Mb p per file and ignoring retention)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Nodes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo operate the service we need one main node and one backup node per snapshot type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequirements:\\\\\\\\n* 10Gbps connection\\\\\\\\n* Only NVME disks (HDDs are too slow for upload and catch ups)\\\\\\\\n* Expected traffic 100Tb+ for RPC, 400Tb+ for archive node (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal 8 nodes, see budget breakdown for details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Setup of the nodes\\\\\\\\n- Development of scripts and tools to generate snapshots\\\\\\\\n- Monitoring and alerts\\\\\\\\n- Publish snapshots at the schedule\\\\\\\\n- Documentation how to download snapshots from the new source\\\\\\\\n- Update near-nodes.io to point to the new solution\\\\\\\\n- Deprecate the legacy S3 solution\\\\\\\\n- A custom documentation website that dynamically provides links to the snapshots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n- Uptime - not missing scheduled snapshots.\\\\\\\\n- Upload speed - how long it takes to publish a snapshot.

There are two common types of nodes:\\\\\\\\n- RPC nodes (as well as validator nodes)\\\\\\\\n- Archive nodes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRPC nodes keep track of all headers and the last N epochs of blocks data. RPC nodes usually require fast NVME SSD disk(s) to keep all data in order to be able to keep up with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArchive nodes keep track of all headers and all blocks data. Archive nodes split state into hot-data and cold-data. The hot-data requires an NVME SSD disk, while cold-data can be kept on the HDDs array. Note, that an archive node with hdd version is not practical for quick RPC queries against older data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo synchronize a nearcore node, the operator usually uses a data snapshot from another synchronized nearcore node and then catches up with the head of the network. This process is much faster than synchronizing the blockchain from the beginning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal is focusing on providing snapshots to the community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Previous state\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, the snapshots were provided by Pagoda and were served from AWS S3 and/or Cloudfront. S3 has a per GB egress cost associated with downloads. Cloudfront price depends on total monthly usage and varies from $30 to $120 per TB, and since regular RPC snapshots are around 1.6 TB, the cost of every RPC download may result in $150.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA mainnet archive snapshot, contains about 62Tb of data. So a single download at $60 per TB costs $3,720.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe storage on S3 is around $22 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the nodes are operated in the AWS, then upload to S3 is free, but if the nodes are hosted outside (e.g. on GCP), then there is a cost associated with uploading data, which for GCP may be around $45 to $90 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the current monthly size of S3 bucket to be around 500-700TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe egress costs may be the highest contributing factor! The egress also increases during resharding events and protocol upgrades (e.g. `2.0.0` release), when some validators fail to upgrade and are forced to sync from the snapshots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the previous infrastructure cost to be from $30,000 to $90,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Solution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s solution is to leverage Cloudflare\\\\\\\\u{2019}s R2 instead of S3, which has no associated egress cost, but instead it is charged based on amount of data stored and number of times each file is accessed. R2 also has lower storage cost per GB than AWS S3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- R2 storage cost per TB is $15 per month.\\\\\\\\n- R2 write costs are $4.5 per 1,000,000 Operations A (usually write, list, etc.)\\\\\\\\n- R2 access cost is $0.36 per 1,000,000 Operations B (which includes read and head requests).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince R2 doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t provide a public S3 endpoint, the snapshots will be accessible through HTTPS using a list of snapshot files in a separate file. It can be downloaded using `rclone` in parallel using one of the provided script, e.g. https://github.com/fastnear/static/blob/main/down_rclone.sh\\\\\\\\nThis setup supports downloading snapshot\\\\\\\\u{2019}s data at high bandwidth by leveraging Cloudflare caching and edge network.\\\\\\\\nWe plan to add md5 verification to verify files integrity and automatically retry downloads for malformed files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Snapshot process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe leverage BTRFS to be able to create a just-in-time snapshot of a storage on the node to decrease downtime of the node. On our proof-of-concept we were able to achieve close to 10Gbps upload speed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimplified process:\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the node\\\\\\\\n2. Snapshot the data using BTRFS\\\\\\\\n3. Start the node\\\\\\\\n4. Generate the file list and md5 hashes\\\\\\\\n5. Upload files to R2\\\\\\\\n6. Upload the file list\\\\\\\\n7. Update list of available snapshots\\\\\\\\n8.

Dashboard of cross chain activities ;\\\\\\\\n- **Launch DEX analytics:** This includes a recent DEX transactions on all pairs across all dexes on NEAR, as well as trading pair details (charts, liquidity, volume, etc) ;\\\\\\\\n- **Near Validate:** rebrand Nearblocks lite to \\\\\\\\u{201c}Near Validate\\\\\\\\u{201d} a bos based explorer for validating transactions, account balances ;\\\\\\\\n- **Account based statistics and charts:** Historical balance, activities etc ;\\\\\\\\n- **Aurora Blocks:** Our Aurora based explorer which we will focus on doing native integration to Nearblocks ;\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability and reliability improvements :** API query improvements, frontend RPC automatic failover. Use RPC as a backup data source in the unlikely case that the indexer is out of sync ;\\\\\\\\n- **Indexer Improvements:** Add fastnear as alternative indexer data source (for when near-lake has an outage). Optimise internal indexers such as handling of errors. Compare contract hashes and retry token detections. Allow faster re-indexing of missed legacy tokens ;\\\\\\\\n- **Near Staking Statistics:** Index the legacy staking stats, so we can return indexed list of delegates, pools, deposits, staking stats and charting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe stay in close communications with most of the teams in need of nearblocks.io. We are also in constant contact with our API clients and are actively outreaching for ad clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs usual, please find a recap of each milestone below : \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #1 (month 0-3)\\\\\\\\nLaunch of the explorer selector on BOS ([link](https://explorer.near.org/)).\\\\\\\\nNearblocks is now open-source ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/)).\\\\\\\\nAs well as fixing outdated bugs, re-indexing missing tokens and infrastructure upgrades.\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #1 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #2 (month 3-6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bulk of the work within these 3 months has been on BOS and our new infrastructure. The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15); \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players\\\\\\\\nContract connect methods updated to use MNW. Wallet selector will be added to BOS version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are currently working the following points on V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTokens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Add SBT token support - Postponed until finalised ([link](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/504))\\\\\\\\n- Transaction execution enhancements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #2 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2). \\\\\\\\nWe are continuing our attempts to support the ecosystem where best we can, with a number of ongoing requests for additional API data endpoints being worked on for multiple use cases such as taxation, validator stats and wallet support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #3 (month 6-9) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithin this milestone we have successfully deployed nearblocks.io on BOS. With this deployment, users can enjoy a faster web experience and developers can leverage a suite of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearblocksonbos.near) - check Widgets tab) we have made available.\\\\\\\\nOther feature requests and improvements done within this milestone : \\\\\\\\n- Contract interactions with embedded ABI ;\\\\\\\\n- Near.social comments section on addresses, transactions and token pages;\\\\\\\\n- Wallet selector integration for contract interactions ;\\\\\\\\n- Additional API endpoints for API users (balance history) ;\\\\\\\\n- Dark mode ;\\\\\\\\n- A new way of visualising a transaction execution plan ([link](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9gQFCZZN2EzjssZkRVZBmgiYjHqfwSAgwX2D62sUhnhP?tab=execution)) ;\\\\\\\\n- FT & NFT holder count in real-time ;\\\\\\\\n- Validator explorer ([link](https://nearblocks.io/node-explorer)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #3 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/3).\\\\\\\\n# Highlights of milestone #4 (month 9-12)\\\\\\\\nNearblocks schema and infrastructure was updated over the past 3 months. A number of breaking changes were forced to be introduced to the API has resulted in significant speed improvements. \\\\\\\\nThis milestone we built the first decentralised explorer on Near. The lite explorer is built on BOS found [here](https://lite.nearblocks.io) (for now) and on social.near gateway allows users to check their transaction by using any of the public RPC nodes available. This offers a solution to look up the status of transactions and accounts without any dependency on a centralised indexer.\\\\\\\\n- Lite explorer ([lite.nearblocks.io](https://lite.nearblocks.io))\\\\\\\\n- Enhanced and tree execution plan\\\\\\\\n- Receipt summary\\\\\\\\n- Display Web3 wallet ie. metamask transactions ([example](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FH7hDFGa3hXzT8EWupRDBzEf4AwPcgpA9HoPDHhHTUAe?tab=execution))\\\\\\\\n- Dex tracking (trades indexing now)\\\\\\\\n- Initial work on aurora integration ([example](https://aurora.exploreblocks.io/))\\\\\\\\n- Spam token list ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/spam-token-list))\\\\\\\\n- Cursor pagination for API clients allowing for unlimited historical data query\\\\\\\\n- Logarithmic chart changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #5 (month 12-15)\\\\\\\\nPlease find below an update on milestone #4. The following points are completed. The ad network and API plan revamp are in the goal of growing additional revenue, easier developer onboarding and allowing other dApps to leverage nearblocks\\\\\\\\u{2019} audience (1M monthly unique users currently).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Proprietary ad network. A self-served ad network has been setup with plans ranging from $100 to $300 per month for full exposure across the entire website to leverage 3M monthly impressions and 1M monthly unique visitors.\\\\\\\\n- Revamp on API plans. A new pricing model on API plans allowing early founders to leverage historical data while adding support for high end users with large data requirements\\\\\\\\n- NEP518. Adds the Ethereum Wallet integration \\\\\\\\n- DEX Analytics created the dex indexer which we will use to populate tradingview charts and analytics \\\\\\\\n- Migrating from BOS back to React. Following the recent [Pagoda announcement](https://docs.near.org/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset), we will be sunsetting Nearblocks on BOS. We completed migration to NextJS and have seen significant improvements in speed and reliability of the user experience\\\\\\\\n- Contract Source code validation\\\\\\\\n- Miscellaneous bug fixes and features including, Bitte wallet integration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow at an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [4], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Explorers\"]}"

The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15); \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players\\\\\\\\nContract connect methods updated to use MNW. Wallet selector will be added to BOS version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are currently working the following points on V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTokens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Add SBT token support - Postponed until finalised ([link](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/504))\\\\\\\\n- Transaction execution enhancements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #2 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2). \\\\\\\\nWe are continuing our attempts to support the ecosystem where best we can, with a number of ongoing requests for additional API data endpoints being worked on for multiple use cases such as taxation, validator stats and wallet support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #3 (month 6-9) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithin this milestone we have successfully deployed nearblocks.io on BOS. With this deployment, users can enjoy a faster web experience and developers can leverage a suite of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearblocksonbos.near) - check Widgets tab) we have made available.\\\\\\\\nOther feature requests and improvements done within this milestone : \\\\\\\\n- Contract interactions with embedded ABI ;\\\\\\\\n- Near.social comments section on addresses, transactions and token pages;\\\\\\\\n- Wallet selector integration for contract interactions ;\\\\\\\\n- Additional API endpoints for API users (balance history) ;\\\\\\\\n- Dark mode ;\\\\\\\\n- A new way of visualising a transaction execution plan ([link](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9gQFCZZN2EzjssZkRVZBmgiYjHqfwSAgwX2D62sUhnhP?tab=execution)) ;\\\\\\\\n- FT & NFT holder count in real-time ;\\\\\\\\n- Validator explorer ([link](https://nearblocks.io/node-explorer)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #3 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/3).\\\\\\\\n# Highlights of milestone #4 (month 9-12)\\\\\\\\nNearblocks schema and infrastructure was updated over the past 3 months. A number of breaking changes were forced to be introduced to the API has resulted in significant speed improvements. \\\\\\\\nThis milestone we built the first decentralised explorer on Near. The lite explorer is built on BOS found [here](https://lite.nearblocks.io) (for now) and on social.near gateway allows users to check their transaction by using any of the public RPC nodes available. This offers a solution to look up the status of transactions and accounts without any dependency on a centralised indexer.\\\\\\\\n- Lite explorer ([lite.nearblocks.io](https://lite.nearblocks.io))\\\\\\\\n- Enhanced and tree execution plan\\\\\\\\n- Receipt summary\\\\\\\\n- Display Web3 wallet ie. metamask transactions ([example](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FH7hDFGa3hXzT8EWupRDBzEf4AwPcgpA9HoPDHhHTUAe?tab=execution))\\\\\\\\n- Dex tracking (trades indexing now)\\\\\\\\n- Initial work on aurora integration ([example](https://aurora.exploreblocks.io/))\\\\\\\\n- Spam token list ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/spam-token-list))\\\\\\\\n- Cursor pagination for API clients allowing for unlimited historical data query\\\\\\\\n- Logarithmic chart changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #5 (month 12-15)\\\\\\\\nPlease find below an update on milestone #4. The following points are completed. The ad network and API plan revamp are in the goal of growing additional revenue, easier developer onboarding and allowing other dApps to leverage nearblocks\\\\\\\\u{2019} audience (1M monthly unique users currently).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Proprietary ad network. A self-served ad network has been setup with plans ranging from $100 to $300 per month for full exposure across the entire website to leverage 3M monthly impressions and 1M monthly unique visitors.\\\\\\\\n- Revamp on API plans. A new pricing model on API plans allowing early founders to leverage historical data while adding support for high end users with large data requirements\\\\\\\\n- NEP518. Adds the Ethereum Wallet integration \\\\\\\\n- DEX Analytics created the dex indexer which we will use to populate tradingview charts and analytics \\\\\\\\n- Migrating from BOS back to React. Following the recent [Pagoda announcement](https://docs.near.org/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset), we will be sunsetting Nearblocks on BOS. We completed migration to NextJS and have seen significant improvements in speed and reliability of the user experience\\\\\\\\n- Contract Source code validation\\\\\\\\n- Miscellaneous bug fixes and features including, Bitte wallet integration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow at an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [4], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"author_id\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

This offers a solution to look up the status of transactions and accounts without any dependency on a centralised indexer.\\\\\\\\n- Lite explorer ([lite.nearblocks.io](https://lite.nearblocks.io))\\\\\\\\n- Enhanced and tree execution plan\\\\\\\\n- Receipt summary\\\\\\\\n- Display Web3 wallet ie. metamask transactions ([example](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FH7hDFGa3hXzT8EWupRDBzEf4AwPcgpA9HoPDHhHTUAe?tab=execution))\\\\\\\\n- Dex tracking (trades indexing now)\\\\\\\\n- Initial work on aurora integration ([example](https://aurora.exploreblocks.io/))\\\\\\\\n- Spam token list ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/spam-token-list))\\\\\\\\n- Cursor pagination for API clients allowing for unlimited historical data query\\\\\\\\n- Logarithmic chart changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #5 (month 12-15)\\\\\\\\nPlease find below an update on milestone #4. The following points are completed. The ad network and API plan revamp are in the goal of growing additional revenue, easier developer onboarding and allowing other dApps to leverage nearblocks\\\\\\\\u{2019} audience (1M monthly unique users currently).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Proprietary ad network. A self-served ad network has been setup with plans ranging from $100 to $300 per month for full exposure across the entire website to leverage 3M monthly impressions and 1M monthly unique visitors.\\\\\\\\n- Revamp on API plans. A new pricing model on API plans allowing early founders to leverage historical data while adding support for high end users with large data requirements\\\\\\\\n- NEP518. Adds the Ethereum Wallet integration \\\\\\\\n- DEX Analytics created the dex indexer which we will use to populate tradingview charts and analytics \\\\\\\\n- Migrating from BOS back to React. Following the recent [Pagoda announcement](https://docs.near.org/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset), we will be sunsetting Nearblocks on BOS. We completed migration to NextJS and have seen significant improvements in speed and reliability of the user experience\\\\\\\\n- Contract Source code validation\\\\\\\\n- Miscellaneous bug fixes and features including, Bitte wallet integration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow at an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [4], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Explorers\"]}"
