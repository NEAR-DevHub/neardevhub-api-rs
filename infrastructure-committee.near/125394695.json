Until then, some of that work comes through the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/).  The NEAR Foundation has appointed and endowed the **NEAR Infrastructure Committee** with a mission to improve and maintain the underlying infrastructure so developers can build successful applications on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee consists of various leaders across the NEAR ecosystem.  Its work involves proposing improvements for the NEAR ecosystem via RFPs, considering and voting on community proposals, and getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe GitHub Wiki provides information about the [Infrastructure Committee](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee) (IC) and the [Working Group](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group) (WG), including current members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Process Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance, upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline new ideas to tackle, urgent problems to solve, or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals in response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions and innovations are crucial to our collective success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGenerally, the process proceeds as follows;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You draft the proposal. Working Group and Committee members are free to review and offer suggestions.\\\\\\\\n2. Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee members.\\\\\\\\n3. In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\\\\\\\\n4. If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline. You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves providing your personal or company information for verification purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is correct.\\\\\\\\n5. Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on our [Github repo](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group) where the community tracks progress on our [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6). Sharing project status gives the community and ecosystem leaders visibility into the status of awarded projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Important Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe following links contain specific information about the processes of responding to RFPs, submitting a proposal, voting, securing funds, and managing the subsequent project for transparency.

This subjective approach helps us be honest, decisive, and unrestrained in our ability to effect change in the NEAR ecosystem.  All RFPs, proposals, committee decisions, and funding allocations are published for community transparency and accountability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThat said, the Committee greatly appreciates proposals that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Add new capabilities to the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Fill in gaps or address challenges faced by NEAR builders and users\\\\\\\\n* Bring new developers or users into the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGenerally speaking, the Committee believes infrastructure providers in the NEAR ecosystem should be economically self-sustaining, with a business model that does not rely on continuous grants from the Committee or other funding bodies.  For instance, we have rejected proposals from RPC providers to fund all setup and operation of RPC nodes so that developers would get free access to RPC services.  But we are open to alternate arrangements, such as loans to help cover initial setup costs and grants in exchange for service credits we (or the NEAR Foundation) can distribute to NEAR builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are also eager to fund projects that benefit the ecosystem but have no direct revenue potential, such as open-source libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOften, a blockchain business involves creating some new open-source specification or protocol and then building a for-profit business on top of that protocol.

Until then, some of that work comes through the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/).  The NEAR Foundation has appointed and endowed the **NEAR Infrastructure Committee** with a mission to improve and maintain the underlying infrastructure so developers can build successful applications on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee consists of various leaders across the NEAR ecosystem.  Its work involves proposing improvements for the NEAR ecosystem via RFPs, considering and voting on community proposals, and getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe GitHub Wiki provides information about the [Infrastructure Committee](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee) (IC) and the [Working Group](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group) (WG), including current members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Process Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance, upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline new ideas to tackle, urgent problems to solve, or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals in response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions and innovations are crucial to our collective success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally, the process proceeds as follows;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You draft the proposal. Working Group and Committee members are free to review and offer suggestions.\\\\\\\\n2. Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee members.\\\\\\\\n3. In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\\\\\\\\n4. If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline. You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves providing your personal or company information for verification purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is correct.\\\\\\\\n5. Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on our [Github repo](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group) where the community tracks progress on our [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6). Sharing project status gives the community and ecosystem leaders visibility into the status of awarded projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Important Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following links contain specific information about the processes of responding to RFPs, submitting a proposal, voting, securing funds, and managing the subsequent project for transparency. Please note that the working group will update articles as processes change. We appreciate your patience and understanding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### [RFPs](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Request-For-Proposals)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### [Submitting a Proposal](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Proposal-Process-%E2%80%90-Team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### [Voting](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Proposal-Process-%E2%80%90-Team#5-voting-on-proposals)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### [Getting Funds](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Funding-Process-%E2%80%90-Company)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### [Managing The Project](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Projects-&-Tasks)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Areas Of Interest\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee will consider any proposal that helps make the NEAR ecosystem a more compelling place for web3 builders and users.  That includes, but is not limited to, these key areas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Protocol Development\\\\\\\\n* Contract and Token Standards\\\\\\\\n* Wallets\\\\\\\\n* Oracles\\\\\\\\n* Bridges\\\\\\\\n* Onramps / Offramps\\\\\\\\n* Relayers\\\\\\\\n* Explorers\\\\\\\\n* Indexers\\\\\\\\n* Data Lakes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Proposal Markup\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease use the following markup templates when submitting the body of your proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposal: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee intentionally does not publish strict evaluation criteria for proposals and does not publish their meeting notes.  This subjective approach helps us be honest, decisive, and unrestrained in our ability to effect change in the NEAR ecosystem.  All RFPs, proposals, committee decisions, and funding allocations are published for community transparency and accountability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, the Committee greatly appreciates proposals that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Add new capabilities to the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Fill in gaps or address challenges faced by NEAR builders and users\\\\\\\\n* Bring new developers or users into the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally speaking, the Committee believes infrastructure providers in the NEAR ecosystem should be economically self-sustaining, with a business model that does not rely on continuous grants from the Committee or other funding bodies.  For instance, we have rejected proposals from RPC providers to fund all setup and operation of RPC nodes so that developers would get free access to RPC services.  But we are open to alternate arrangements, such as loans to help cover initial setup costs and grants in exchange for service credits we (or the NEAR Foundation) can distribute to NEAR builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also eager to fund projects that benefit the ecosystem but have no direct revenue potential, such as open-source libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOften, a blockchain business involves creating some new open-source specification or protocol and then building a for-profit business on top of that protocol.  We are open to funding that effort\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\u{201c}protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d} portion to help get your NEAR ecosystem business off the ground.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Important Announcements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant policy or procedure changes, notices, and urgent communications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Regular Quarterly Wallet Support - Policy](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/134)\"}"

That includes, but is not limited to, these key areas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Protocol Development\\\\\\\\n* Contract and Token Standards\\\\\\\\n* Wallets\\\\\\\\n* Oracles\\\\\\\\n* Bridges\\\\\\\\n* Onramps / Offramps\\\\\\\\n* Relayers\\\\\\\\n* Explorers\\\\\\\\n* Indexers\\\\\\\\n* Data Lakes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Proposal Markup\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease use the following markup templates when submitting the body of your proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposal: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee intentionally does not publish strict evaluation criteria for proposals and does not publish their meeting notes.  This subjective approach helps us be honest, decisive, and unrestrained in our ability to effect change in the NEAR ecosystem.  All RFPs, proposals, committee decisions, and funding allocations are published for community transparency and accountability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, the Committee greatly appreciates proposals that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Add new capabilities to the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Fill in gaps or address challenges faced by NEAR builders and users\\\\\\\\n* Bring new developers or users into the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally speaking, the Committee believes infrastructure providers in the NEAR ecosystem should be economically self-sustaining, with a business model that does not rely on continuous grants from the Committee or other funding bodies.  For instance, we have rejected proposals from RPC providers to fund all setup and operation of RPC nodes so that developers would get free access to RPC services.  But we are open to alternate arrangements, such as loans to help cover initial setup costs and grants in exchange for service credits we (or the NEAR Foundation) can distribute to NEAR builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also eager to fund projects that benefit the ecosystem but have no direct revenue potential, such as open-source libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOften, a blockchain business involves creating some new open-source specification or protocol and then building a for-profit business on top of that protocol.  We are open to funding that effort\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\u{201c}protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d} portion to help get your NEAR ecosystem business off the ground.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Important Announcements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant policy or procedure changes, notices, and urgent communications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Regular Quarterly Wallet Support - Policy](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/134)\"}}}}"

We provide the quickest, easiest and cheapest way to buy/sell stablecoins. We currently support stablecoins on ERC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BASE, Solana and SX networks. This is the first time that users can buy stablecoins in Canada directly on the network of their choice, without having to jump through hoops/bridging etc. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur proposal is to integrate PayTrie with the NEAR ecosystem and enable on and off-ramping of USDC on NEAR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nPayTrie has successfully been operating in Canada over the past 4 years with the current business model and has on/off-ramped more than $500M in volume. It is clear from the demand that we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing on other stablecoins and networks, that users want an option to get directly on-chain without having to jump through hoops. We are also the only option in Canada that does not custody users\\\\\\\\\\\\' funds. We receive fiat and send out the stablecoins right away. We believe that this is the way that crypto should be bought and sold and we attract users who understand the importance of this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn ecosystem is only as healthy as the on/off ramp solutions. PayTrie will allow Canadians to directly on-ramp onto NEAR and provide net-new liquidity to the network. We believe that launching our on/off ramp for USDC on NEAR would bring a lot of value to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?)\\\\\\\\nThis will not be open source\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nGoal #1: Partnership start - This is when we start the efforts to integrate with the NEAR ecosystem. We will need to take our dev resources to research everything needed to start the integration\\\\\\\\nGoal #2: USDC-NEAR Launch - 4-6 weeks after the initial partnership start, we will officially launch the capability to on and off-ramp USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nVolume - amount of USDC-NEAR that is on/off ramped through PayTrie\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\nPayTrie does not have a direct competitor when it comes to the stablecoin side of the business. Most of the companies in Canada are exchanges and they do not have a focus on stablecoins. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$50,000 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Breakdown of funds usage. How will you use these funds? Be specific.)\\\\\\\\n$40,000 - Development resources - implementing USDC on NEAR will take significant dev resources. We will need to either hire somebody who has knowledge of this or re-prioritize our existing team away from other projects to implement USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n$10,000 - We will be providing each on-ramp transaction with a small amount of $NEAR so that the user can interact with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"paytriejt.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"50000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Onramps / Offramps\"]}"

He is a young Polish blockchain developer who graduated with a Master\\\\\\\\u{2019}s degree from the University of Science and Technology in Cracow. Before starting his own company, he worked as a trader at Star Beta and as a full-stack engineer at Rumblefish. Norbert has gained coding experience on several blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. He is one of the early contributors to the Anchor framework. His main focus is decentralized finance; his first major project, Synthetify, led him to win the 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon. He is also a contributor and advisor to several projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, we have won several hackathons, such as the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. As a team, we have been awarded multiple grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\nWe have been developing a wallet on NEAR since 2022 and received a grant that year. We have many partner projects, including Burrow Finance, Metapool, Everstake, and REF Finance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have established successful partnerships with other projects to provide our users with additional features. For example, we have implemented a swap feature thanks to our partnership with REF Finance and offer liquid staking through our cooperation with Metapool. Additionally, users can stake directly through the wallet and choose from a variety of validators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\nOur core team has been working in crypto since 2020, though we have individually contributed to various other projects as well. We launched Nightly in Q2 2022. Initially, it was a wallet supporting only NEAR and Solana, but it now operates on over 10 chains, including Sui and EVMs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, our team was involved in two major projects: Synthetify, a decentralized synthetic assets exchange built on Solana, and Invariant, an AMM DEX operating on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero.\\\\\\\\nOur team focuses on bringing new users to crypto by lowering the entry point. We offer a range of solutions, such as the \\\\\\\\\\\\'dApps\\\\\\\\\\\\' tab, which showcases the most important projects on the chain; the ability to buy tokens directly in the wallet; and Nightly Connect, which facilitates the connection between dApps and wallets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have achieved victories in various hackathons, including the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. Our team has also secured several grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nWe were among the first wallets on NEAR. We were the first to fully support NEAR Wallet migration and the first to implement cross-chain functionality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur wallet has pioneered advanced features such as liquid staking within the wallet, in-wallet swaps, and DApps integration. We successfully developed Nightly Connect v1 to simplify the connection between the wallet and dApps, implemented hardware wallet support, and integrated domain management directly within the wallet. Additionally, we have built a fully supported mobile wallet on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese achievements have advanced NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s capabilities and solidified our position as innovators in the ecosystem. However, we are continuously seeking new opportunities to develop features such as a Safari extension and the Earn tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\nWe are a fully independent team with our own Backend, Frontend, Design, and Marketing/BD teams. We are capable of building new features, developing smart contracts, and organizing activities such as AMAs and other community events both online and offline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\nEngineering Team: 9\\\\\\\\nDesign, UX/UI: 2\\\\\\\\nProject Management: 1\\\\\\\\nCustomer Support: 1\\\\\\\\nBD/Marketing: 2\\\\\\\\nTotal: 15 people\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Wallet - a multi-chain wallet designed to harness the full potential of blockchain. It includes both a browser extension and a mobile wallet, supporting Solana, NEAR, Aptos, Sui, Aleph Zero, Vara, Movement, Sonic, Polkadot and EVM.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect - a permissionless, open-source tool that functions as both a wallet adapter and a bridge wallet, enabling connections via QR codes or deep links. It simplifies the process for dApp developers by automatically adding all standard-compliant wallets after a one-time implementation. While minimal changes are needed on the wallet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s side for compatibility, these updates allow any mobile wallet to connect to any dApp through Nightly Connect, with additional features like push notifications. It is currently available on Solana, Sui, Aptos, and Movement, with plans to implement it on NEAR as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInvariant - a peer-to-peer system on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero for trading assets. It uses smart contracts to ensure security, self-custody, and resistance to censorship, all without relying on intermediaries who could limit access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (The primary approach and solution of the proposal.)\\\\\\\\nNightly and NEAR share similar approaches to the future of their products. NEAR projects are expanding and exploring cross-blockchain solutions in the Web3 space (https://near.org/blog/nuffle-labs). Nightly aligns with these values as the first multi-chain wallet supporting NEAR, and we continue to integrate additional chains to provide our users with a comprehensive experience, including easily accessible blockchains and their unique features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, we believe that successful products must continually evolve to make crypto usage as simple and accessible as possible. To this end, we have been diligently developing new features over the past few months. Notable additions include:\\\\\\\\n- Sidepanel: This feature allows our extension wallet to function as a constantly open side panel alongside the active extension.\\\\\\\\n- Mobile App: We are updating our mobile wallet to mirror the features of our extension wallet, ensuring it is equally functional and useful.\\\\\\\\n- Hardware Wallet Integrations: We are working on supporting various hardware wallets, including Keystone, and are also aiming to integrate Keystone support into our mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur primary goal is to enhance the functionality and utility of crypto wallets, making them essential tools for interacting with any dApp. At Nightly, we are committed to expanding the capabilities of wallets beyond their traditional roles. We have made significant progress in diversifying our income through various revenue streams, including partnerships with other dApps. These strategic collaborations will enable us to create sustainable and profitable solutions within the wallet ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n- Staking: We partner with validators such as Everstake to encourage users to stake through Nightly.\\\\\\\\n- Liquid Staking: Our partnership with Metapool allows users to liquid stake and receive stNEAR directly in their wallets without leaving the platform.\\\\\\\\n- Swaps: We have partnered with REF Finance and integrated their dApp into our wallet, allowing NEAR users to swap tokens directly within Nightly. We receive a fee from REF Finance for these transactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese features are already implemented in Nightly, but we aim to offer even more possibilities for an enhanced wallet experience, making Nightly the central hub for NEAR while ensuring our \\\\\\\\nsustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also developing additional features to help generate yield:\\\\\\\\nEarn Tab: This feature within our wallet allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens to on-chain dApps directly from the wallet. It includes options for borrowing, lending, creating pools, and liquid staking. Users will see APYs for each option, providing a comprehensive view in one place. This feature will also increase exposure for dApps on NEAR, enabling us to charge them a fee for the yield generated through this feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned before, we have been one of the first wallets on NEAR and the first multi-chain wallet. Additionally, we were the first wallet to support NEAR Wallet migration. Our dedication to NEAR is evident, and our goal is not only to maintain our wallet and develop new solutions for ourselves but also to advance NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe aim to develop the NEAR wallet standard. Our objective is to preserve all existing functionalities while transitioning to a wallet standard that supports multiple wallets, similar to how it works on Solana, Sui, or Ethereum (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963). We have already implemented a similar solution for Aptos (https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md). This transition will enhance security, speed, and ease of use. NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current infrastructure requires a robust wallet standard, and we are well-positioned to not only maintain but also enhance it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, Nightly Connect could improve analytics by analyzing traffic and providing more comprehensive data, such as connections with dApps, used wallets, or time spent on dApps.\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n- We currently have 8,000 WAU (Weekly Active Users) and aim for at least 30% of them to start managing their tokens primarily through Nightly. This means not only holding tokens within our wallet but also taking proactive steps like lending or liquid staking through our \\\\\\\\u{201c}Earn\\\\\\\\u{201d} tab.\\\\\\\\n- Add hardware support to the mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop support for a Safari extension to make iOS usage even easier.\\\\\\\\n- Implement push notifications within the wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop QR code payments.\\\\\\\\n- Develop Nightly Connect on NEAR to assist with gathering data and tracking traffic for dApps and wallets, in line with NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current development approach.\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that the NEAR wallet standard built by us will be accepted by all wallets on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n- Advance wallet development to achieve full sustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Be sure to communicate what the finished effort looks like.)\\\\\\\\nOnce we successfully integrate all our planned activities and develop the new features, we aim to double our user base and ensure that at least 30% of our users engage with NEAR dApps directly via Nightly.\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect will be completed, open-sourced, and ready for integration by dApps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Should include a timeline with milestones, including what will be delivered for each milestone.)\\\\\\\\nQuarter 1: Develop the mentioned features (Earn tab, hardware wallet support, Safari extension) and conduct marketing activities to promote these features.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 2: Build the new wallet standard for NEAR and pursue business development to encourage all NEAR wallets to implement it. Continue development of existing features within the wallet.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 3: Develop Nightly Connect to track dApp and wallet traffic, prepare analytics for this solution, and focus on business development and marketing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nThe key success metrics we will track are:\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using dApp features within the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Number of dApps that integrate Nightly Connect\\\\\\\\n- Number of wallets that implement the new wallet standard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (How will we measure success?)\\\\\\\\nWe can track these statistics directly within the wallet.

He is a young Polish blockchain developer who graduated with a Master\\\\\\\\u{2019}s degree from the University of Science and Technology in Cracow. Before starting his own company, he worked as a trader at Star Beta and as a full-stack engineer at Rumblefish. Norbert has gained coding experience on several blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. He is one of the early contributors to the Anchor framework. His main focus is decentralized finance; his first major project, Synthetify, led him to win the 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon. He is also a contributor and advisor to several projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, we have won several hackathons, such as the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. As a team, we have been awarded multiple grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\nWe have been developing a wallet on NEAR since 2022 and received a grant that year. We have many partner projects, including Burrow Finance, Metapool, Everstake, and REF Finance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have established successful partnerships with other projects to provide our users with additional features. For example, we have implemented a swap feature thanks to our partnership with REF Finance and offer liquid staking through our cooperation with Metapool. Additionally, users can stake directly through the wallet and choose from a variety of validators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\nOur core team has been working in crypto since 2020, though we have individually contributed to various other projects as well. We launched Nightly in Q2 2022. Initially, it was a wallet supporting only NEAR and Solana, but it now operates on over 10 chains, including Sui and EVMs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, our team was involved in two major projects: Synthetify, a decentralized synthetic assets exchange built on Solana, and Invariant, an AMM DEX operating on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero.\\\\\\\\nOur team focuses on bringing new users to crypto by lowering the entry point. We offer a range of solutions, such as the \\\\\\\\\\\\'dApps\\\\\\\\\\\\' tab, which showcases the most important projects on the chain; the ability to buy tokens directly in the wallet; and Nightly Connect, which facilitates the connection between dApps and wallets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have achieved victories in various hackathons, including the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. Our team has also secured several grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nWe were among the first wallets on NEAR. We were the first to fully support NEAR Wallet migration and the first to implement cross-chain functionality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur wallet has pioneered advanced features such as liquid staking within the wallet, in-wallet swaps, and DApps integration. We successfully developed Nightly Connect v1 to simplify the connection between the wallet and dApps, implemented hardware wallet support, and integrated domain management directly within the wallet. Additionally, we have built a fully supported mobile wallet on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese achievements have advanced NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s capabilities and solidified our position as innovators in the ecosystem. However, we are continuously seeking new opportunities to develop features such as a Safari extension and the Earn tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\nWe are a fully independent team with our own Backend, Frontend, Design, and Marketing/BD teams. We are capable of building new features, developing smart contracts, and organizing activities such as AMAs and other community events both online and offline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\nEngineering Team: 9\\\\\\\\nDesign, UX/UI: 2\\\\\\\\nProject Management: 1\\\\\\\\nCustomer Support: 1\\\\\\\\nBD/Marketing: 2\\\\\\\\nTotal: 15 people\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Wallet - a multi-chain wallet designed to harness the full potential of blockchain. It includes both a browser extension and a mobile wallet, supporting Solana, NEAR, Aptos, Sui, Aleph Zero, Vara, Movement, Sonic, Polkadot and EVM.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect - a permissionless, open-source tool that functions as both a wallet adapter and a bridge wallet, enabling connections via QR codes or deep links. It simplifies the process for dApp developers by automatically adding all standard-compliant wallets after a one-time implementation. While minimal changes are needed on the wallet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s side for compatibility, these updates allow any mobile wallet to connect to any dApp through Nightly Connect, with additional features like push notifications. It is currently available on Solana, Sui, Aptos, and Movement, with plans to implement it on NEAR as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInvariant - a peer-to-peer system on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero for trading assets. It uses smart contracts to ensure security, self-custody, and resistance to censorship, all without relying on intermediaries who could limit access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (The primary approach and solution of the proposal.)\\\\\\\\nNightly and NEAR share similar approaches to the future of their products. NEAR projects are expanding and exploring cross-blockchain solutions in the Web3 space (https://near.org/blog/nuffle-labs). Nightly aligns with these values as the first multi-chain wallet supporting NEAR, and we continue to integrate additional chains to provide our users with a comprehensive experience, including easily accessible blockchains and their unique features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, we believe that successful products must continually evolve to make crypto usage as simple and accessible as possible. To this end, we have been diligently developing new features over the past few months. Notable additions include:\\\\\\\\n- Sidepanel: This feature allows our extension wallet to function as a constantly open side panel alongside the active extension.\\\\\\\\n- Mobile App: We are updating our mobile wallet to mirror the features of our extension wallet, ensuring it is equally functional and useful.\\\\\\\\n- Hardware Wallet Integrations: We are working on supporting various hardware wallets, including Keystone, and are also aiming to integrate Keystone support into our mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur primary goal is to enhance the functionality and utility of crypto wallets, making them essential tools for interacting with any dApp. At Nightly, we are committed to expanding the capabilities of wallets beyond their traditional roles. We have made significant progress in diversifying our income through various revenue streams, including partnerships with other dApps. These strategic collaborations will enable us to create sustainable and profitable solutions within the wallet ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n- Staking: We partner with validators such as Everstake to encourage users to stake through Nightly.\\\\\\\\n- Liquid Staking: Our partnership with Metapool allows users to liquid stake and receive stNEAR directly in their wallets without leaving the platform.\\\\\\\\n- Swaps: We have partnered with REF Finance and integrated their dApp into our wallet, allowing NEAR users to swap tokens directly within Nightly. We receive a fee from REF Finance for these transactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese features are already implemented in Nightly, but we aim to offer even more possibilities for an enhanced wallet experience, making Nightly the central hub for NEAR while ensuring our \\\\\\\\nsustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also developing additional features to help generate yield:\\\\\\\\nEarn Tab: This feature within our wallet allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens to on-chain dApps directly from the wallet. It includes options for borrowing, lending, creating pools, and liquid staking. Users will see APYs for each option, providing a comprehensive view in one place. This feature will also increase exposure for dApps on NEAR, enabling us to charge them a fee for the yield generated through this feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned before, we have been one of the first wallets on NEAR and the first multi-chain wallet. Additionally, we were the first wallet to support NEAR Wallet migration. Our dedication to NEAR is evident, and our goal is not only to maintain our wallet and develop new solutions for ourselves but also to advance NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe aim to develop the NEAR wallet standard. Our objective is to preserve all existing functionalities while transitioning to a wallet standard that supports multiple wallets, similar to how it works on Solana, Sui, or Ethereum (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963). We have already implemented a similar solution for Aptos (https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md). This transition will enhance security, speed, and ease of use. NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current infrastructure requires a robust wallet standard, and we are well-positioned to not only maintain but also enhance it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, Nightly Connect could improve analytics by analyzing traffic and providing more comprehensive data, such as connections with dApps, used wallets, or time spent on dApps.\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n- We currently have 8,000 WAU (Weekly Active Users) and aim for at least 30% of them to start managing their tokens primarily through Nightly. This means not only holding tokens within our wallet but also taking proactive steps like lending or liquid staking through our \\\\\\\\u{201c}Earn\\\\\\\\u{201d} tab.\\\\\\\\n- Add hardware support to the mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop support for a Safari extension to make iOS usage even easier.\\\\\\\\n- Implement push notifications within the wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop QR code payments.\\\\\\\\n- Develop Nightly Connect on NEAR to assist with gathering data and tracking traffic for dApps and wallets, in line with NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current development approach.\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that the NEAR wallet standard built by us will be accepted by all wallets on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n- Advance wallet development to achieve full sustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Be sure to communicate what the finished effort looks like.)\\\\\\\\nOnce we successfully integrate all our planned activities and develop the new features, we aim to double our user base and ensure that at least 30% of our users engage with NEAR dApps directly via Nightly.\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect will be completed, open-sourced, and ready for integration by dApps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Should include a timeline with milestones, including what will be delivered for each milestone.)\\\\\\\\nQuarter 1: Develop the mentioned features (Earn tab, hardware wallet support, Safari extension) and conduct marketing activities to promote these features.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 2: Build the new wallet standard for NEAR and pursue business development to encourage all NEAR wallets to implement it. Continue development of existing features within the wallet.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 3: Develop Nightly Connect to track dApp and wallet traffic, prepare analytics for this solution, and focus on business development and marketing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nThe key success metrics we will track are:\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using dApp features within the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Number of dApps that integrate Nightly Connect\\\\\\\\n- Number of wallets that implement the new wallet standard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (How will we measure success?)\\\\\\\\nWe can track these statistics directly within the wallet. Additionally, we can monitor metrics such as unique users, events conducted within the wallet, users\\\\\\\\u{2019} devices, and newly created wallets.\\\\\\\\nAfter each quarter, we will prepare a summary of our progress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n$50,000 quarterly, according to https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/134\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Breakdown of funds usage.

Benefits for Near**\\\\\\\\nAlterscope\\\\\\\\\\\\'s objective is to provide a comprehensive, real-time view on relevant risk metrics to enable sound due diligence for users, liquidity providers, and developers in the ecosystem of Near. Our core aim is to set Near apart from other ecosystems and to support its vision in, while providing the highest possible degree of security to its users. We are eager to support the Near team in the process of creating a neutral community dashboard that significantly reduces the burden for users and developers to analyze and monitor critical events in the ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, partnering with us provides the following benefits for Near: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tAdvanced Risk Mapping with Proprietary Methodologies: Our developed methodologies allow for precise mapping of dApps and associated risks, achieving multidimensional comparability across various dApp categories within the Near ecosystem.
