As [Pagoda winds down its services](https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-08-13-pagoda-services), there is a need to transition the management and development of the Kit Wallet Indexer to a capable service provider. The transition aims to ensure uninterrupted service of this vital data infrastructure, which is essential for various stakeholders in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Current live endpoints**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Mainnet [https://api.kitwallet.app/](https://api.kitwallet.app/) (currently hosted on AWS)\\\\\\\\n* Testnet [https://testnet-api.kitwallet.app/](https://testnet-api.kitwallet.app/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Include the following endpoints on mainnet and testnet:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/publicKey/:publicKey/accounts\\\\\\\\\\\\', findAccountsByPublicKey);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/staking-deposits/:accountId\\\\\\\\\\\\', findStakingDeposits);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/activity\\\\\\\\\\\\', findAccountActivity);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/callReceivers\\\\\\\\\\\\', findReceivers);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyTokens\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyTokens);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyNFTs\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyNFTs);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyTokensFromBlock\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyTokensFromBlock);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyNFTsFromBlock\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyNFTsFromBlock);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/stakingPools\\\\\\\\\\\\', findStakingPools);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe graph below indicates the most recent usage for the past months KitWallet LB requests: ~350K per day (average response time is less than 0.14 seconds, but there are spikes of 50 seconds or more currently)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![alt_text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b10c0a-7aba-4d44-bd33-7a5ae05e42e1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![alt_text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c4fc10a-8b12-48be-be65-c1b01336b7d5 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: the majority of endpoint usage, [FastNear](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) already supports_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis Kit Wallet Indexer API is undocumented and not officially supported.  Because of this, many wallets that are more NEAR \\\\\\\\u{201c}native\\\\\\\\u{201d} have already switched to other solutions like [FastNEAR](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs).  But there are still many [non-custodial](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector) and exchange wallets that depend on the Kit Wallet Indexer service or that we are still confirming their usage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not have data available which NEAR ecosystem projects are currently using Kit Wallet Indexer but these should include wallets and exchanges and any projects that need to quickly query different token balances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEcosystem projects that have already  transitioned off of Kit Wallet to better-maintained services include [Nightly](https://nightly.app/), [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/), MyNEARWallet, NEAR Mobile Wallet, and [Bitte/Mintbase Wallet](wallet.bitte.ai).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Monitoring, Alerting, Reporting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Real-time monitoring of system health and performance with public forward facing status page\\\\\\\\n* Alerts for data inconsistencies or indexing delays and public channel & direct communication with major stakeholders using service\\\\\\\\n* Internal Dashboard for visualizing system metrics\\\\\\\\n* Weekly progress reports during the transition phase to Infrastructure committee asynchronous \\\\\\\\n* Quarterly performance and usage reports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**As part of this transition, maintenance, and proposals, please include;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Comprehensive system architecture documentation\\\\\\\\n* API documentation including usage examples (mentioning the service will be deprecated and linked to alternative solutions like _[FastNear](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) _) \\\\\\\\n* User guide for common queries and use cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition Steps for selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Review and understand the current Kit Wallet Indexer API infrastructure (including accompanying infra like NEAR Lake) and processes.\\\\\\\\n2. Include detailed transition plan,in your milestones\\\\\\\\n3. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team.\\\\\\\\n4. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team.\\\\\\\\n5. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n6. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n7. Update all relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n8. Gradually transition operational responsibilities.\\\\\\\\n9. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n10. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n11. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders\\\\\\\\n12. As part of this RFP and based on current usage, the goal is to provide this as a public good. Part of this transition strategy may include pushing users to alternatives like FastNEAR API. \\\\\\\\n13. Estimated transition time, not taking into account any KYC or KYB blockers, is 1 week.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.0% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 0.1% of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**:\\\\\\\\n    * *This should be tracked internally and shared with Infrastructure Committee (IC)*\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n        * Better or in line with existing response time.\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n        * Please outline your rate limiting plan to continue to support Kit Wallet as a public good, if applicable. \\\\\\\\n3. **Support**\\\\\\\\n* **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n* **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours. A single point of contact for urgent issues.\\\\\\\\n4. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n* **Data Consistency**: \\\\\\\\n    * Ensure that there is data validation in place (to show proper information). \\\\\\\\n    * Proper backup of data is maintained and the data is up to date. \\\\\\\\n5. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n* **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least 7 days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n* **Versioning**: Ensure that the new API versions will be backward-compatible wherever possible.\\\\\\\\n* Maintenance - Proper updates to the community and stakeholders about any major maintenance which could impact the service, experience and uptime of the API adversely. \\\\\\\\n6. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. \\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n7. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n8. **Failure to Perform:** If Kit Wallet maintenance falls below the performance aforementioned benchmarks, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include upon signing of agreement, upon official transition, 6 month billing period, 12 month billing period, \\\\\\\\u{2026} and so forth. \\\\\\\\n* **Contingency**: Include a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. In the event that expense for providing free or a public good to the NEAR ecosystem, there should be a clear policy to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:** Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol is a plus.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:** Demonstrate that your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building and maintaining this infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternatives to Kit Wallet;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Fast NEAR API Server: [https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) (hosted free alternative)\\\\\\\\n* Pagoda enhanced api: [https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/](https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/) \\\\\\\\n* NEARBlocks api: [https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory](https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory) \\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet ZMQ Indexer [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer)  \\\\\\\\n* [Mintbase Indexer](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support;** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Indexer Working Group [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kit Wallet Resources;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Past Proposals;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet [https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.[ Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TVvPXPJhZfaFwfA2UMW6c3pO2kis45SJ1Np1XOkkhnA/edit?usp=sharing) is a standard (+ [markup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing)) template you can use as a starting point. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMarketing materials, presentations, and images can be attached as needed as external links.

As [Pagoda winds down its services](https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-08-13-pagoda-services), there is a need to transition the management and development of the Kit Wallet Indexer to a capable service provider. The transition aims to ensure uninterrupted service of this vital data infrastructure, which is essential for various stakeholders in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Current live endpoints**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Mainnet [https://api.kitwallet.app/](https://api.kitwallet.app/) (currently hosted on AWS)\\\\\\\\n* Testnet [https://testnet-api.kitwallet.app/](https://testnet-api.kitwallet.app/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Include the following endpoints on mainnet and testnet:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/publicKey/:publicKey/accounts\\\\\\\\\\\\', findAccountsByPublicKey);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/staking-deposits/:accountId\\\\\\\\\\\\', findStakingDeposits);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/activity\\\\\\\\\\\\', findAccountActivity);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/callReceivers\\\\\\\\\\\\', findReceivers);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyTokens\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyTokens);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyNFTs\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyNFTs);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyTokensFromBlock\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyTokensFromBlock);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/account/:accountId/likelyNFTsFromBlock\\\\\\\\\\\\', findLikelyNFTsFromBlock);\\\\\\\\n* router.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\'/stakingPools\\\\\\\\\\\\', findStakingPools);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe graph below indicates the most recent usage for the past months KitWallet LB requests: ~350K per day (average response time is less than 0.14 seconds, but there are spikes of 50 seconds or more currently)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![alt_text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b10c0a-7aba-4d44-bd33-7a5ae05e42e1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![alt_text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c4fc10a-8b12-48be-be65-c1b01336b7d5 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_tooltip\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: the majority of endpoint usage, [FastNear](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) already supports_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis Kit Wallet Indexer API is undocumented and not officially supported.  Because of this, many wallets that are more NEAR \\\\\\\\u{201c}native\\\\\\\\u{201d} have already switched to other solutions like [FastNEAR](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs).  But there are still many [non-custodial](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector) and exchange wallets that depend on the Kit Wallet Indexer service or that we are still confirming their usage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not have data available which NEAR ecosystem projects are currently using Kit Wallet Indexer but these should include wallets and exchanges and any projects that need to quickly query different token balances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEcosystem projects that have already  transitioned off of Kit Wallet to better-maintained services include [Nightly](https://nightly.app/), [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/), MyNEARWallet, NEAR Mobile Wallet, and [Bitte/Mintbase Wallet](wallet.bitte.ai).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Monitoring, Alerting, Reporting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Real-time monitoring of system health and performance with public forward facing status page\\\\\\\\n* Alerts for data inconsistencies or indexing delays and public channel & direct communication with major stakeholders using service\\\\\\\\n* Internal Dashboard for visualizing system metrics\\\\\\\\n* Weekly progress reports during the transition phase to Infrastructure committee asynchronous \\\\\\\\n* Quarterly performance and usage reports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**As part of this transition, maintenance, and proposals, please include;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Comprehensive system architecture documentation\\\\\\\\n* API documentation including usage examples (mentioning the service will be deprecated and linked to alternative solutions like _[FastNear](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) _) \\\\\\\\n* User guide for common queries and use cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition Steps for selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Review and understand the current Kit Wallet Indexer API infrastructure (including accompanying infra like NEAR Lake) and processes.\\\\\\\\n2. Include detailed transition plan,in your milestones\\\\\\\\n3. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team.\\\\\\\\n4. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team.\\\\\\\\n5. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n6. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n7. Update all relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n8. Gradually transition operational responsibilities.\\\\\\\\n9. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n10. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n11. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders\\\\\\\\n12. As part of this RFP and based on current usage, the goal is to provide this as a public good. Part of this transition strategy may include pushing users to alternatives like FastNEAR API. \\\\\\\\n13. Estimated transition time, not taking into account any KYC or KYB blockers, is 1 week.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.0% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 0.1% of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**:\\\\\\\\n    * *This should be tracked internally and shared with Infrastructure Committee (IC)*\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n        * Better or in line with existing response time.\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n        * Please outline your rate limiting plan to continue to support Kit Wallet as a public good, if applicable. \\\\\\\\n3. **Support**\\\\\\\\n* **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n* **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours. A single point of contact for urgent issues.\\\\\\\\n4. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n* **Data Consistency**: \\\\\\\\n    * Ensure that there is data validation in place (to show proper information). \\\\\\\\n    * Proper backup of data is maintained and the data is up to date. \\\\\\\\n5. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n* **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least 7 days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n* **Versioning**: Ensure that the new API versions will be backward-compatible wherever possible.\\\\\\\\n* Maintenance - Proper updates to the community and stakeholders about any major maintenance which could impact the service, experience and uptime of the API adversely. \\\\\\\\n6. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. \\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n7. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n8. **Failure to Perform:** If Kit Wallet maintenance falls below the performance aforementioned benchmarks, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included.

The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include upon signing of agreement, upon official transition, 6 month billing period, 12 month billing period, \\\\\\\\u{2026} and so forth. \\\\\\\\n* **Contingency**: Include a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. In the event that expense for providing free or a public good to the NEAR ecosystem, there should be a clear policy to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:** Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol is a plus.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:** Demonstrate that your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building and maintaining this infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternatives to Kit Wallet;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Fast NEAR API Server: [https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) (hosted free alternative)\\\\\\\\n* Pagoda enhanced api: [https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/](https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/) \\\\\\\\n* NEARBlocks api: [https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory](https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory) \\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet ZMQ Indexer [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer)  \\\\\\\\n* [Mintbase Indexer](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support;** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Indexer Working Group [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kit Wallet Resources;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Past Proposals;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet [https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

A single point of contact for urgent issues.\\\\\\\\n4. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n* **Data Consistency**: \\\\\\\\n    * Ensure that there is data validation in place (to show proper information). \\\\\\\\n    * Proper backup of data is maintained and the data is up to date. \\\\\\\\n5. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n* **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least 7 days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n* **Versioning**: Ensure that the new API versions will be backward-compatible wherever possible.\\\\\\\\n* Maintenance - Proper updates to the community and stakeholders about any major maintenance which could impact the service, experience and uptime of the API adversely. \\\\\\\\n6. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. \\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n7. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n8. **Failure to Perform:** If Kit Wallet maintenance falls below the performance aforementioned benchmarks, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include upon signing of agreement, upon official transition, 6 month billing period, 12 month billing period, \\\\\\\\u{2026} and so forth. \\\\\\\\n* **Contingency**: Include a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. In the event that expense for providing free or a public good to the NEAR ecosystem, there should be a clear policy to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:** Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol is a plus.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:** Demonstrate that your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building and maintaining this infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternatives to Kit Wallet;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Fast NEAR API Server: [https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) (hosted free alternative)\\\\\\\\n* Pagoda enhanced api: [https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/](https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/) \\\\\\\\n* NEARBlocks api: [https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory](https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory) \\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet ZMQ Indexer [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer)  \\\\\\\\n* [Mintbase Indexer](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support;** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Indexer Working Group [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kit Wallet Resources;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Past Proposals;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet [https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

It is used by countless applications and wallets, including some of the most popular NEAR applications. However, we recognize that, by being hosted on near.org and offered at no cost to developers, the service contributes to unwanted centralization of the NEAR ecosystem.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNear.org RPC will become a heavily rate-limited \\\\\\\\u{201c}free tier\\\\\\\\u{201d} or demo-only service, maintaining backward compatibility with existing dev tooling and low-traffic applications.  High-traffic applications will be responsible for migrating their RPC usage to an alternative provider.  As part of this RFP, the new operator for this rate-limited near.org RPC service will be allowed to advertise their related commercial offering to these users, with the limits described below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Technical Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee (IC) seeks a new operator for these four URLs during or after the transformation into a free-tier-only service:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://rpc.mainnet.near.org](https://rpc.mainnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://rpc.testnet.near.org](https://rpc.testnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://archival-rpc.mainnet.near.org](https://archival-rpc.mainnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://archival-rpc.testnet.near.org](https://archival-rpc.testnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe current implementation of near.org RPC relies primarily on [Read-RPC](https://github.com/near/read-rpc/), a specially optimized backend server, and a ScyllaDB database built to handle NEAR RPC queries at scale. Some requests are routed to a scaled fleet of standard or archival [NEAR RPC nodes](https://near-nodes.io/rpc) running on Google Cloud. All underlying systems conform to the [NEAR RPC API regardless of where a request is routed](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe new operator is welcome to use any or all of the current setups or their own. However, they must establish new relationships with the necessary cloud service providers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Current Rate Limits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese are the existing rate limits applied by Pagoda (current maintainers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RPC\\\\\\\\n  * 9000 requests/10s (27000 requests/30s) per IP (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n  * 2000 requests/30s per IP (testnet)\\\\\\\\n* Archival-RPC\\\\\\\\n  * 1000 requests/30s per IP (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n  * 2000 requests/30s per IP (testnet)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: There is no authentication on these RPC endpoints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few NEAR Foundation partners (dApps) are exempt from the rate limits above, consume a high load of RPC services, and receive white glove service provided by the Pagoda SRE team. They\\\\\\\\u{2019}re identified by using special Referer headers in their requests. These partners have been notified that this level of service will be ending, and they have been encouraged to move out to alternative RPC providers that meet their production demands. After 01-Feb-2025, if they choose to remain on near.org RPC, they will be subject to the same rate limits as everyone else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transformation into Demo Environment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, we seek to turn near.org RPC into a free-tier / demo environment only by gradually lowering rate limits until the beginning of February.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPagoda will execute this transformation according to the schedule below until the new operator takes over; at this point, they will be expected to continue that transformation. The Infrastructure Committee will prioritize proposals for an earlier transition to the new operator instead of waiting for the Pagoda team to finish lowering the rate limits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis RFP aims to ensure that the special partners using near.org RPC for high-traffic loads are not adversely affected during and after this transition period. Near Foundation will work with the Pagoda SRE team and the new operator to ensure that their workload seamlessly migrates to the new RPC provider of their choice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOctober 15th:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet:** 15000 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet:** 1500 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet:** 800 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet:** 1500 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNovember 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 5000 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 1200 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 400 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 800 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecember 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 2000 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 900 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 200 requests/30s IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 400 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJanuary 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 500 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 600 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 100 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 200 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFebruary 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 150 req/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 300 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 20 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 100 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Rate limits will be applied by IP or by the HTTP \\\\\\\\u{201c}Referer\\\\\\\\u{201d} header, whichever hits first. Frontend applications will likely be rate-limited by the referrer, while backend applications will likely be rate-limited by the IP address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe maintenance requirements of this RPC service are listed below:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Collaborate with Pagoda SRE for any knowledge transfer and handover of the current endpoints\\\\\\\\n  * The current load balancer maintained by the Pagoda SRE team allows for a gradual transition. This will help ensure a smoother transition and better downtime management during the transition phase.\\\\\\\\n  * 100% target date before 01-Feb-2025, but we encourage an earlier transition during the rate limit decrease (as mentioned above), especially for overflow business\\\\\\\\n* Timely nearcore upgrades. There is a five-day time frame for deploying the latest [nearcore releases](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases).\\\\\\\\n* Maintain monitoring and alerting system, showing the health of RPC systems\\\\\\\\n* Maintain external-facing status page (for example, [Helius Network](https://helius.statuspage.io/)) showing incidents and uptimes, and communicate across company social platforms and relevant partners.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Security\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Proposals must include a comprehensive security plan, including DDoS protection measures, IP whitelisting capabilities, and detailed logging and monitoring strategies.\\\\\\\\n* Vendors must provide a detailed disaster recovery and business continuity plan, including regular backup procedures and a strategy for quick service restoration in case of major outages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.9% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 44 minutes of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**\\\\\\\\n    * These are tracked internally and shared with the Infrastructure Committee (IC)**\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n    * **Mainnet RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 1 second\\\\\\\\n    * **Testnet RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 1.5 seconds\\\\\\\\n    * **Archival-RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 2 seconds\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n    * 150 req/30s\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limit Enforcement**: Strict enforcement with immediate rate limit application once thresholds are reached\\\\\\\\n    * Note: It would be good to have an external dashboard with these stats and historical data for the last 30 days.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Pricing**\\\\\\\\n    * The new RPC service provider must not accept payments for RPC services on near.org. However, it can advertise its service as a separate paid RPC with higher rate limits, as described below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Advertising**\\\\\\\\n    * If you serve GET requests or a homepage at any of the RPC URLs above, that page can advertise your associated services, but it must:\\\\\\\\n    * Make it clear in postings or advertisements that your services are not directly affiliated with or operated by NEAR or the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n    * Include a prominent link to [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. When a user is rate-limited, you must return an HTTP 429 response.\\\\\\\\n    * The response body is up to you and can also be used to advertise your associated services.  But if you do so, that response body must also contain the URL [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).\\\\\\\\n        * For instance, an acceptable response body is <code>{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"jsonrpc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": -429, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rate limits exceeded. For higher rate limits, try [http://myrpcprovider.example](http://myrpcprovider.example) or other RPC providers at [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}</code>.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. The Infrastructure Committee may from time to time evaluate any advertising on the near.org RPC service and demand changes within reason to conform to the guidelines above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. **Support**\\\\\\\\n    * **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through online help desk, forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours for generic services.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n    * **Data Consistency**: Standard (non-archival) RPC nodes must always serve five-time epochs. Both RPC and Archival nodes track all NEAR shards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n    * **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least seven days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **Compensation for Outages:** There are no financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. However, if there are partners who utilize your paid service, they should agree on separate customized SLAs with the RPC provider directly.\\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. **Failure to Perform:** If vendor RPC services fall below the performance benchmarks mentioned above, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technology Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreferences\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Proposers are encouraged to use current technology (load balancers, readrpc, nodes) and optimize performance to save on costs.\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) to decentralized RPC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Expertise Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Already operating current NEAR RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) Pagoda ex-employees, including SREs that previously maintained this infrastructure or other existing NEAR ecosystem partners\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition steps for the selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team for DNS records and any other associated infrastructure related to DNS service (for example - load balancers)\\\\\\\\n2. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team, including one on [ReadRPC,](https://github.com/near/read-rpc) in case the vendor wants to inherit that tech.\\\\\\\\n3. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n4. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n5. Gain access to relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n6. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n7. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n8. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should outline a detailed budget with a clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance and support, infrastructure, third-party services, and external API costs. Maintenance costs should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Properly assessing a budget based on usage is a significant factor in qualifying legitimate entities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease highlight the details of the various milestones in your development plan and the relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around the milestone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s success (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include signing the agreement, the official transition, a 6-month or 12-month billing period, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Contingency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclude a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. Suppose expenses for providing free services or public goods to the NEAR ecosystem exceed previous budgets. In that case, a clear policy should be to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Current Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are some of the statistics related to the current usage of RPC services provided by the Pagoda SRE team:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RPC Mainnet - 6k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Mainnet - 2k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC Testnet - 400 requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Testnet - 150 requests/s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequests have been stagnant, fluctuating from a steady 10k RPS to peaks of 25k RPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technical Expertise and Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated expertise in building and maintaining high-performance RPC infrastructure for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Minimum two years of experience working with blockchain RPC systems\\\\\\\\n* Strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture and technical specifications\\\\\\\\n* Proven track record of handling high transaction volumes and ensuring low latency\\\\\\\\n* Experience with scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Completed at least one similar RPC infrastructure project for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Positive references from previous blockchain clients or projects\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated ability to meet or exceed service level agreements (SLAs) for uptime and performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Pricing Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A clear breakdown of costs for implementation, maintenance, and scaling\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to consider performance-based pricing incentives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Alignment with Web3 and NEAR Values\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to decentralization and open-source principles\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated support for blockchain interoperability and cross-chain communication\\\\\\\\n* Alignment with NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s vision of empowering developers and users\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to privacy and data protection in line with Web3 ethos\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Governance Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clear and transparent decision-making processes within the organization\\\\\\\\n* Defined roles and responsibilities for project management and technical leadership\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to regular communication and reporting to NEAR stakeholders\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to participate in NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s governance processes and community discussions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant - All NEAR-related RPC information can be found at [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers) (it is also important to note that many of these providers also offer free RPC service)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Boilerplate)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

Frontend applications will likely be rate-limited by the referrer, while backend applications will likely be rate-limited by the IP address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe maintenance requirements of this RPC service are listed below:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Collaborate with Pagoda SRE for any knowledge transfer and handover of the current endpoints\\\\\\\\n  * The current load balancer maintained by the Pagoda SRE team allows for a gradual transition. This will help ensure a smoother transition and better downtime management during the transition phase.\\\\\\\\n  * 100% target date before 01-Feb-2025, but we encourage an earlier transition during the rate limit decrease (as mentioned above), especially for overflow business\\\\\\\\n* Timely nearcore upgrades. There is a five-day time frame for deploying the latest [nearcore releases](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases).\\\\\\\\n* Maintain monitoring and alerting system, showing the health of RPC systems\\\\\\\\n* Maintain external-facing status page (for example, [Helius Network](https://helius.statuspage.io/)) showing incidents and uptimes, and communicate across company social platforms and relevant partners.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Security\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Proposals must include a comprehensive security plan, including DDoS protection measures, IP whitelisting capabilities, and detailed logging and monitoring strategies.\\\\\\\\n* Vendors must provide a detailed disaster recovery and business continuity plan, including regular backup procedures and a strategy for quick service restoration in case of major outages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.9% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 44 minutes of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**\\\\\\\\n    * These are tracked internally and shared with the Infrastructure Committee (IC)**\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n    * **Mainnet RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 1 second\\\\\\\\n    * **Testnet RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 1.5 seconds\\\\\\\\n    * **Archival-RPC**: Average response time of \\\\\\\\u{2264} 2 seconds\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n    * 150 req/30s\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limit Enforcement**: Strict enforcement with immediate rate limit application once thresholds are reached\\\\\\\\n    * Note: It would be good to have an external dashboard with these stats and historical data for the last 30 days.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Pricing**\\\\\\\\n    * The new RPC service provider must not accept payments for RPC services on near.org. However, it can advertise its service as a separate paid RPC with higher rate limits, as described below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Advertising**\\\\\\\\n    * If you serve GET requests or a homepage at any of the RPC URLs above, that page can advertise your associated services, but it must:\\\\\\\\n    * Make it clear in postings or advertisements that your services are not directly affiliated with or operated by NEAR or the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n    * Include a prominent link to [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. When a user is rate-limited, you must return an HTTP 429 response.\\\\\\\\n    * The response body is up to you and can also be used to advertise your associated services.  But if you do so, that response body must also contain the URL [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).\\\\\\\\n        * For instance, an acceptable response body is <code>{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"jsonrpc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": -429, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rate limits exceeded. For higher rate limits, try [http://myrpcprovider.example](http://myrpcprovider.example) or other RPC providers at [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}</code>.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. The Infrastructure Committee may from time to time evaluate any advertising on the near.org RPC service and demand changes within reason to conform to the guidelines above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. **Support**\\\\\\\\n    * **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through online help desk, forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours for generic services.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n    * **Data Consistency**: Standard (non-archival) RPC nodes must always serve five-time epochs. Both RPC and Archival nodes track all NEAR shards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n    * **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least seven days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **Compensation for Outages:** There are no financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. However, if there are partners who utilize your paid service, they should agree on separate customized SLAs with the RPC provider directly.\\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. **Failure to Perform:** If vendor RPC services fall below the performance benchmarks mentioned above, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technology Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreferences\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Proposers are encouraged to use current technology (load balancers, readrpc, nodes) and optimize performance to save on costs.\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) to decentralized RPC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Expertise Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Already operating current NEAR RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) Pagoda ex-employees, including SREs that previously maintained this infrastructure or other existing NEAR ecosystem partners\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition steps for the selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team for DNS records and any other associated infrastructure related to DNS service (for example - load balancers)\\\\\\\\n2. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team, including one on [ReadRPC,](https://github.com/near/read-rpc) in case the vendor wants to inherit that tech.\\\\\\\\n3. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n4. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n5. Gain access to relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n6. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n7. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n8. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should outline a detailed budget with a clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance and support, infrastructure, third-party services, and external API costs. Maintenance costs should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Properly assessing a budget based on usage is a significant factor in qualifying legitimate entities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease highlight the details of the various milestones in your development plan and the relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around the milestone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s success (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include signing the agreement, the official transition, a 6-month or 12-month billing period, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Contingency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclude a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. Suppose expenses for providing free services or public goods to the NEAR ecosystem exceed previous budgets. In that case, a clear policy should be to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Current Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are some of the statistics related to the current usage of RPC services provided by the Pagoda SRE team:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RPC Mainnet - 6k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Mainnet - 2k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC Testnet - 400 requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Testnet - 150 requests/s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequests have been stagnant, fluctuating from a steady 10k RPS to peaks of 25k RPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technical Expertise and Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated expertise in building and maintaining high-performance RPC infrastructure for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Minimum two years of experience working with blockchain RPC systems\\\\\\\\n* Strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture and technical specifications\\\\\\\\n* Proven track record of handling high transaction volumes and ensuring low latency\\\\\\\\n* Experience with scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Completed at least one similar RPC infrastructure project for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Positive references from previous blockchain clients or projects\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated ability to meet or exceed service level agreements (SLAs) for uptime and performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Pricing Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A clear breakdown of costs for implementation, maintenance, and scaling\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to consider performance-based pricing incentives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Alignment with Web3 and NEAR Values\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to decentralization and open-source principles\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated support for blockchain interoperability and cross-chain communication\\\\\\\\n* Alignment with NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s vision of empowering developers and users\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to privacy and data protection in line with Web3 ethos\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Governance Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clear and transparent decision-making processes within the organization\\\\\\\\n* Defined roles and responsibilities for project management and technical leadership\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to regular communication and reporting to NEAR stakeholders\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to participate in NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s governance processes and community discussions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant - All NEAR-related RPC information can be found at [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers) (it is also important to note that many of these providers also offer free RPC service)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Boilerplate)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

It is used by countless applications and wallets, including some of the most popular NEAR applications. However, we recognize that, by being hosted on near.org and offered at no cost to developers, the service contributes to unwanted centralization of the NEAR ecosystem.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNear.org RPC will become a heavily rate-limited \\\\\\\\u{201c}free tier\\\\\\\\u{201d} or demo-only service, maintaining backward compatibility with existing dev tooling and low-traffic applications.  High-traffic applications will be responsible for migrating their RPC usage to an alternative provider.  As part of this RFP, the new operator for this rate-limited near.org RPC service will be allowed to advertise their related commercial offering to these users, with the limits described below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Technical Overview\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee (IC) seeks a new operator for these four URLs during or after the transformation into a free-tier-only service:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://rpc.mainnet.near.org](https://rpc.mainnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://rpc.testnet.near.org](https://rpc.testnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://archival-rpc.mainnet.near.org](https://archival-rpc.mainnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n* [https://archival-rpc.testnet.near.org](https://archival-rpc.testnet.near.org)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe current implementation of near.org RPC relies primarily on [Read-RPC](https://github.com/near/read-rpc/), a specially optimized backend server, and a ScyllaDB database built to handle NEAR RPC queries at scale. Some requests are routed to a scaled fleet of standard or archival [NEAR RPC nodes](https://near-nodes.io/rpc) running on Google Cloud. All underlying systems conform to the [NEAR RPC API regardless of where a request is routed](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe new operator is welcome to use any or all of the current setups or their own. However, they must establish new relationships with the necessary cloud service providers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Current Rate Limits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese are the existing rate limits applied by Pagoda (current maintainers).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RPC\\\\\\\\n  * 9000 requests/10s (27000 requests/30s) per IP (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n  * 2000 requests/30s per IP (testnet)\\\\\\\\n* Archival-RPC\\\\\\\\n  * 1000 requests/30s per IP (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n  * 2000 requests/30s per IP (testnet)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: There is no authentication on these RPC endpoints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few NEAR Foundation partners (dApps) are exempt from the rate limits above, consume a high load of RPC services, and receive white glove service provided by the Pagoda SRE team. They\\\\\\\\u{2019}re identified by using special Referer headers in their requests. These partners have been notified that this level of service will be ending, and they have been encouraged to move out to alternative RPC providers that meet their production demands. After 01-Feb-2025, if they choose to remain on near.org RPC, they will be subject to the same rate limits as everyone else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transformation into Demo Environment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, we seek to turn near.org RPC into a free-tier / demo environment only by gradually lowering rate limits until the beginning of February.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPagoda will execute this transformation according to the schedule below until the new operator takes over; at this point, they will be expected to continue that transformation. The Infrastructure Committee will prioritize proposals for an earlier transition to the new operator instead of waiting for the Pagoda team to finish lowering the rate limits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis RFP aims to ensure that the special partners using near.org RPC for high-traffic loads are not adversely affected during and after this transition period. Near Foundation will work with the Pagoda SRE team and the new operator to ensure that their workload seamlessly migrates to the new RPC provider of their choice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOctober 15th:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet:** 15000 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet:** 1500 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet:** 800 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet:** 1500 requests/30s per IP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNovember 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 5000 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 1200 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 400 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 800 requests/30s per IP **or referrer**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecember 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 2000 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 900 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 200 requests/30s IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 400 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJanuary 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 500 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 600 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 100 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 200 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFebruary 1st\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Mainnet**: 150 req/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **RPC Testnet**: 300 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Mainnet**: 20 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n* **Archival-RPC Testnet**: 100 requests/30s per IP or referrer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Rate limits will be applied by IP or by the HTTP \\\\\\\\u{201c}Referer\\\\\\\\u{201d} header, whichever hits first.

The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technology Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreferences\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Proposers are encouraged to use current technology (load balancers, readrpc, nodes) and optimize performance to save on costs.\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) to decentralized RPC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Expertise Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Already operating current NEAR RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n* Preference (not requirement) Pagoda ex-employees, including SREs that previously maintained this infrastructure or other existing NEAR ecosystem partners\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition steps for the selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team for DNS records and any other associated infrastructure related to DNS service (for example - load balancers)\\\\\\\\n2. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team, including one on [ReadRPC,](https://github.com/near/read-rpc) in case the vendor wants to inherit that tech.\\\\\\\\n3. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n4. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n5. Gain access to relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n6. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n7. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n8. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProposals should outline a detailed budget with a clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance and support, infrastructure, third-party services, and external API costs. Maintenance costs should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Properly assessing a budget based on usage is a significant factor in qualifying legitimate entities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease highlight the details of the various milestones in your development plan and the relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around the milestone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s success (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include signing the agreement, the official transition, a 6-month or 12-month billing period, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Contingency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInclude a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. Suppose expenses for providing free services or public goods to the NEAR ecosystem exceed previous budgets. In that case, a clear policy should be to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Current Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are some of the statistics related to the current usage of RPC services provided by the Pagoda SRE team:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RPC Mainnet - 6k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Mainnet - 2k requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC Testnet - 400 requests/s\\\\\\\\n* RPC-Archival Testnet - 150 requests/s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequests have been stagnant, fluctuating from a steady 10k RPS to peaks of 25k RPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Technical Expertise and Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated expertise in building and maintaining high-performance RPC infrastructure for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Minimum two years of experience working with blockchain RPC systems\\\\\\\\n* Strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture and technical specifications\\\\\\\\n* Proven track record of handling high transaction volumes and ensuring low latency\\\\\\\\n* Experience with scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Past Performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Completed at least one similar RPC infrastructure project for blockchain networks\\\\\\\\n* Positive references from previous blockchain clients or projects\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated ability to meet or exceed service level agreements (SLAs) for uptime and performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Pricing Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A clear breakdown of costs for implementation, maintenance, and scaling\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to consider performance-based pricing incentives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Alignment with Web3 and NEAR Values\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to decentralization and open-source principles\\\\\\\\n* Demonstrated support for blockchain interoperability and cross-chain communication\\\\\\\\n* Alignment with NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s vision of empowering developers and users\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to privacy and data protection in line with Web3 ethos\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Governance Structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clear and transparent decision-making processes within the organization\\\\\\\\n* Defined roles and responsibilities for project management and technical leadership\\\\\\\\n* Commitment to regular communication and reporting to NEAR stakeholders\\\\\\\\n* Willingness to participate in NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s governance processes and community discussions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant - All NEAR-related RPC information can be found at [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers) (it is also important to note that many of these providers also offer free RPC service)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Boilerplate)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.
