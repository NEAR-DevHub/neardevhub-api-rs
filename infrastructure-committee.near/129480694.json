With our extensive experience in indexing and integration, we are well-positioned to ensure a seamless transition for KitWallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Response to Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt Nearblocks.io, we have already created drop-in replaceable KitWallet endpoints, which means there will be no need to build additional infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, two wallets already use our endpoint:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMyNEARWallet:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![nearblocks_meteor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/365e8d8f-6b7d-44e9-bd22-668831a1b847)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeteor Wallet:\\\\\\\\n![nearblocks_mynearwallet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a333b29-6f00-450e-9d74-708fd354369a)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA transition plan would simply be updating `https://api.kitwallet.app/` to `https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/kitwallet/`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis gives us a distinct advantage in terms of efficiency and speed for this transition. Our ongoing communication with members of the Pagoda team & infrastructure committee further reinforces our commitment to staying aligned with the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks is built on top of Near Lake as the data source and currently operates as the #1 explorer within the ecosystem. We believe Nearblocks is in the best position to support this transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Current live endpoints (documentation):**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Mainnet: https://api.nearblocks.io/api-docs/#/Kitwallet\\\\\\\\n- Testnet: https://api-testnet.nearblocks.io/api-docs/#/Kitwallet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Service Level\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Monitoring\\\\\\\\nWe will set up monitoring with notifications for visualizing API availability. System health and performance are available here: https://status.nearblocks.io. From our status monitor, we can send email and/or Slack notifications to major stakeholders. For reference, Nearblocks has been able to maintain a monthly uptime of 99.83%. We are aiming for 99.99% in the coming weeks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Response Time\\\\\\\\nAverage response time on the Nearblocks API is now sub-2 seconds. Legacy KitWallet endpoints are using LIKE queries, which are known to be less performant. We have avoided this due to additional indexing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent caveat: `likelyTokens` only supports tokens which Nearblocks supports. This includes all NEP-141 tokens and *most* [legacy tokens](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/tree/main/apps/indexer-events/src/services/contracts/ft). We are constantly working to add missing [legacy tokens](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=token_request.md&title=).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Rate Limiting\\\\\\\\nNearblocks API rate limiting is enforced by IP address and API keys. Given this is a public good endpoint, we will limit 150 queries per minute per IP address. We believe this should be within a very generous fair usage policy. This can be made flexible and is open for discussion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Support\\\\\\\\n- Support Availability: GitHub issues available here https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues \\\\\\\\n- Response Time: 24-48 hours through GitHub issues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Data Integrity\\\\\\\\nThe KitWallet endpoints are backed by existing Nearblocks data, which is indexed from Near Lake.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Updates and Changes\\\\\\\\nWe have no plans to make changes to KitWallet endpoints. We previously created these endpoints to support drop-in replacements without any work required other than replacing the endpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Usage\\\\\\\\nWe will track KitWallet usage through the Nearblocks API key dashboard for real-time usage. This can be made available to stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![API Usage Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceefc8e0-a74a-4299-8bdb-98258c0f7ca1)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Approach\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Move Nearblocks KitWallet endpoints to be accessible from the existing endpoint (i.e., https://api.kitwallet.app/) to allow for a seamless transition experience with no downtime for any existing users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. We are aware that there are remaining unknown users using this legacy endpoint. As we can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reach out to suggest a transition to alternative solutions, we will set up a landing page on kitwallet.app stating the current situation and directing them to alternative solutions as well as a point of contact that will be monitored. The landing page will explain the KitWallet transition plans with links to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Existing Documentation with user guide\\\\\\\\n- Support available through GitHub Issues\\\\\\\\n- Alternatives like Nearblocks API and FastNear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$4,000 / month for 12 months - to ensure excess capacity for additional traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Experience & Portfolio\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks.io is our flagship product; however, we have built other products in the past on NEAR, such as nearsend.io.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThank you for considering Nearblocks.io. We look forward to the possibility of working together to bring this transition to completion. Please don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or clarifications.\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"48000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": []}"

The core Near Lake data buckets will continue to be maintained on AWS S3. Due to the large volume and high importance of Near Lake data, we believe that S3 is the most suitable option.

We will monitor the Near Lake S3 and the Indexer RPC nodes separately to perform RCA in the event of block height delays.\\\\\\\\n4.
