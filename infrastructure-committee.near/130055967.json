Rumors are there will be 10 shards by the EOY, which might increase throughput of the network and the amount of data.\\\\\\\\n- Target blocks per second should be `1`.\\\\\\\\n- The current storage is around 40Tb for the mainnet and 8Tb for the testnet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBreakdown:\\\\\\\\n- S3 storage per month (at 84Tb avg): $2107.39\\\\\\\\n- Estimated objects per network per month: 28,908,000\\\\\\\\n- Writes per month: $936.6\\\\\\\\n- Reads per month: $63\\\\\\\\n- Safety margin: 20%\\\\\\\\n- Total: **$3804 per month**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Maintenance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe ask for **$8,000** a month for maintenance and support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Knowledge transfer (1 week)\\\\\\\\n- Setup nodes once the write access is received (1 week)\\\\\\\\n- Transfer of S3 bucket ownership\\\\\\\\n- Dedicated status page entry (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Public latency monitoring dashboard (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Documentation updates if necessary (4 weeks)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Block timestamp to wall latency (expected most blocks to be available under 5 seconds).

Resulting in 320M calls per day.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Reliability and Security\\\\\\\\n- Experienced in handling:\\\\\\\\n  - Traffic surges of 30,000 RPS\\\\\\\\n  - DDoS attacks (recently)\\\\\\\\n  - Provider outages\\\\\\\\n  - Testnet/mainnet issues\\\\\\\\n- Free NEAR Lake alternative at https://neardata.xyz\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Monitoring and Performance\\\\\\\\n- Internal monitoring and alert systems\\\\\\\\n- External status page https://status.fastnear.com\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### (Background) NEARDATA by FASTNEAR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR provides a simple and free alternative to the publicly available S3-based service NEAR Lake Framework called NEARDATA (https://neardata.xyz).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFeatures:\\\\\\\\n- Data is grouped by blocks.\\\\\\\\n- Data is accessible through HTTPS for free.\\\\\\\\n- Each `ExecutionOutcome` for every Action Receipt contains originating transaction hash.\\\\\\\\n- Data is cached locally and by Cloudflare.\\\\\\\\n- Ability to read blocks from the browser.\\\\\\\\n- Ability to get recent optimistic blocks.\\\\\\\\n- Ability to download raw archived data. Useful for backfills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample of the blocks timestamp to the wall time latency from NEARDATA:\\\\\\\\n![NEARDATA Latency](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0033340-0d66-4c92-be45-14e632bb9df8)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR is already indexing and serving the following:\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Mainnet Final blocks\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Mainnet Optimistic blocks (with an average of 1- second wall to block-timestamp latency)\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Testnet Final blocks https://testnet.neardata.xyz\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Testnet Optimistic blocks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe provide data in the following formats:\\\\\\\\n- Full indexed blocks (including all data for all shards) in JSON file accessible throught HTTPS. Examples:\\\\\\\\n    - Latest finalized mainnet block: https://mainnet.neardata.xyz/v0/last_block/final\\\\\\\\n    - Latest optimistic mainnet block: https://mainnet.neardata.xyz/v0/last_block/optimistic\\\\\\\\n    - Latest finalized testnet block: https://testnet.neardata.xyz/v0/last_block/final\\\\\\\\n    - Block `123456789` on mainnet: https://mainnet.neardata.xyz/v0/block/123456789\\\\\\\\n    - Block `123456789` on testnet: https://testnet.neardata.xyz/v0/block/123456789\\\\\\\\n- Pending finalized blocks. When you request a block by height that is close to the head, but is not produced yet, the server will hold the connection until the block becomes available. Making it easy to implement indexers.\\\\\\\\n- Archival data by 10 block archives, allows to quickly backfill data.

Consider the nodes cost included into the monthly maintenance fee.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote, that in the future a single node for all shards might not be sufficient, so indexing nodes will need to produce shards independently. That\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where our expertise of the customized setups will be helpful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### S3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is very good S3 cost estimate provided in the following proposal by Aurora Labs: https://near.social/infrastructure-committee.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=28\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe recommend a few adjustments to the estimate:\\\\\\\\n- The storage might grow due to the increase in the number of shards. Rumors are there will be 10 shards by the EOY, which might increase throughput of the network and the amount of data.\\\\\\\\n- Target blocks per second should be `1`.\\\\\\\\n- The current storage is around 40Tb for the mainnet and 8Tb for the testnet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBreakdown:\\\\\\\\n- S3 storage per month (at 84Tb avg): $2107.39\\\\\\\\n- Estimated objects per network per month: 28,908,000\\\\\\\\n- Writes per month: $936.6\\\\\\\\n- Reads per month: $63\\\\\\\\n- Safety margin: 20%\\\\\\\\n- Total: **$3804 per month**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Maintenance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe ask for **$8,000** a month for maintenance and support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Knowledge transfer (1 week)\\\\\\\\n- Setup nodes once the write access is received (1 week)\\\\\\\\n- Transfer of S3 bucket ownership\\\\\\\\n- Dedicated status page entry (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Public latency monitoring dashboard (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Documentation updates if necessary (4 weeks)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Block timestamp to wall latency (expected most blocks to be available under 5 seconds). Similar to a live latency test from NEARDATA https://neardata.xyz/\\\\\\\\n- Uptime (expected 99.9%)\\\\\\\\n- Consistency: no-skipped data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Compensation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor maintenance and development we ask for $12,000 a month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$11,800 per month (paid monthly) for the duration of 12 months.\\\\\\\\n- $3,800 AWS S3\\\\\\\\n- $8,000 maintenance \\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"treasury.fastnear.tg\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"141600\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"mob.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

Key team members include:\\\\\\\\n- Chris Bruce, CEO - 5x Technical Founder, formerly Head of Product Development and Board of Directors at Helium, https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisabruce/\\\\\\\\n- Caleb Call, VP Infrastructure, formerly Head of Platform Engineering at Ripple, https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebcall/\\\\\\\\n- Matei Popa, Blockchain Reliability Engineer, previously Senior DevOps Engineer at CoW Protocol, https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateipopa/\\\\\\\\n- Cade Call, Blockchain Reliability Engineer, previously Lead DevOps Engineer at Medici Ventures, https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadecall/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy started as one of the most successful Validators as a Service platforms on Helium and at one point was operating over 50% of the Helium network. Our services offered the best cost-to-performance ratio and had the highest ROI out of all the other providers.\\\\\\\\n- We later ran Helium\\\\\\\\u{2019}s entire public API. Consisting of over 30 clustered Postgres servers with 40TB of data each and 20 application servers (scaling as high as 100 when needed). We migrated Helium off AWS and ran everything in house on bare metal hardware. We implemented our own custom caching configuration, multi-region load balancing, and rate limiting. At its peak, we were handling over 300M requests/day. Additionally, we ran nearly 20 private APIs for companies like Binance, Crypto.com, Seed, and Nova Labs.\\\\\\\\n- Today we use the same custom built infrastructure to run over 500 nodes with support for over 30 protocols and adding new protocols and nodes weekly. We are currently serving nearly 2B rpc requests per month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Examples of Relevant Experience with Helium Blockchain Public RPC:**\\\\\\\\n- Operated Helium\\\\\\\\u{2019}s entire public API, in house on bare metal\\\\\\\\n- Operated the largest Validators as a Service for the Helium Network, 1600 validators\\\\\\\\n- Using our custom build infrastructure, we saved helium over $2M/year in operational costs\\\\\\\\n- Our Helium validators had the lowest cost and highest ROI out of the entire network\\\\\\\\n- Ran private Helium APIs for Binance, Crypto.com, Seed, and Nova Labs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Examples of Relevant Experience with NEAR Blockchain:**\\\\\\\\n- Integration of NEAR Blockchain to BlockVisor, enabling one-click deployment of high performance, unmetered RPC nodes to any server.  Features of Blockvisor include: one-click deployment, monitoring, alerting, logging on per node instance, efficient image upgrade and downgrade procedure, fast enrollment of new server to system, powerful management UX. All on bare metal servers resulting in lower costs and higher performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Main Appproach and Solution\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy has developed a purpose-built suite of tools designed specifically for operating and managing Blockchain Nodes on bare metal servers (servers running without virtual machines, docker, or kubernetes) without the mismatched Web2 tooling. These tools enable BlockJoy to run nodes in a highly performant manner resulting in higher throughput and lower operating costs than is typically seen on virtual machine and container based systems. Based on our experience, we can typically operate at 20% or less the cost of running on the cloud. Furthermore, we typically remove 3-5ms from response times of container based virtualization.\\\\\\\\n- For execution of this grant, we will utilize BlockJoy\\\\\\\\u{2019}s purpose-built node orchestration technology to efficiently handle node deployment, version updates, monitoring and alerting of full nodes and archive nodes. \\\\\\\\n- We will leverage our partnerships with several of the leading bare metal datacenter providers around the world for our bare metal servers and use best in class hardware (Gen4 AMD EPYC CPUs, NVMe5 disks, and a 10Gb network.) We strongly believe this helps to build a more diverse and resilient network that all protocols should be striving for. As a case in point, Hetzner, without notice, decided to pull the plug on all Solana validators running within their data centers, resulting in around 30% of solana\\\\\\\\u{2019}s validators going offline and triggering a huge token price crash. \\\\\\\\n- We will implement a robust load balancer to ensure high availability throughput and low latency. This system will incorporate global load balancing to efficiently route traffic to the nearest RPC nodes. We will establish rate limiting based on criteria such as URI, request volume across multiple time windows, upstream host capabilities, number of connections to the upstream host, response time, and IP address. Additionally, our solution will include caching specific calls to provide quicker response times. We will also conduct automatic health checks on upstream nodes to swiftly identify and replace any unhealthy nodes from the network, ensuring continuous and reliable service.\\\\\\\\n- We will implement a monitoring and alerting system that includes the following components:\\\\\\\\n  - External Synthetic Checks: Conducted from eight geographic locations to ensure nodes are operational and responding with expected results. Alerts will be triggered for failures such as non-200 responses, long response times, or unexpected responses.\\\\\\\\n  - Ping Checks: Performed on every host system to verify simple up/down status, with alerts issued if a system goes down.\\\\\\\\n  - Full System Metrics: Monitored for prolonged high CPU load, high memory usage, and low disk space, with alerts for any prolonged issues.\\\\\\\\n  - System and Blockchain Logs Collection: Alerts will be generated for error events, out-of-memory events, and blockchain-specific events as appropriate.\\\\\\\\n  - Full Blockchain Metrics Collection: Monitored from the client side, with alerts for RPC errors and other protocol-specific metrics.\\\\\\\\n  - Load Balancer Monitoring: Includes external synthetic checks from eight geographic locations to ensure functionality, with alerts for failures such as non-200 responses or unexpected results.\\\\\\\\n  - External-Facing Status Page: We will implement a nice looking custom status page utilizing a tool such as Atlassian Statuspage.\\\\\\\\n- We will implement a comprehensive security plan that includes robust DDoS protection via Cloudflare with IP whitelisting and blocking capabilities. We maintain detailed logging and monitoring with 13-month retention allowing for year-over-year analysis and behavior trends, utilizing the LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir). \\\\\\\\n- Disaster recovery will be addressed through our regular snapshot service.  We maintain nodes that are used to take regular snapshots, we then store multiple versions of those snapshots which allows us to quickly deploy new nodes.  This also allows us to scale very quickly as well if there are unexpected sustained surges in traffic.  In addition to maintaining snapshots, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve established strategic partnerships with Data Centers throughout the world maintaining strong relationships and ensuring we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re not reliant on any one hardware provider.\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy\\\\\\\\\\\\'s SRE team will provide ad-hoc support on community forums, GitHub issues, and developer community channels such as Slack, Telegram, and Discord, with best-effort responses within 24-48 hours for generic services. We will assist in updating documentation for node operation on near.org.  Additionally, we will offer white-glove service support to facilitate the transition of high-priority overflow business, assisting in the migration of high-value users from public RPC to private NEAR RPC providers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why Choose This Project:**\\\\\\\\n- Our team offers proven expertise in high-performance RPC infrastructure, a strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture, and a commitment to decentralization and open-source principles.\\\\\\\\nWe believe in the philosophy of the Near token project and our founder has been a Near token holder long before the last Crypto crash.\\\\\\\\n- Our team has extensive experience in building and maintaining high-performance public RPC infrastructure on decentralized networks of bare metal servers for tier one blockchain networks such as Helium and Ripple. Additionally, we have on staff software developers constantly improving our tooling so our nodes can perform their best.\\\\\\\\n- We have a strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture and technical specifications.\\\\\\\\n- We have a proven track record of handling high transaction volumes and ensuring low latency in a cost efficient manner.\\\\\\\\n- Lastly, our software is designed to run and manage blockchain nodes on any infrastructure.

BlockJoy specializes in Node Operation and Management and is backed by Gradient Ventures (Google\\\\\\\\u{2019}s venture arm), Borderless Capital, Draper Dragon, Tribe Capital, Active Capital, and other crypto and infrastructure investors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Primary Contact Information:**\\\\\\\\n  - Name: Eric Ullrich\\\\\\\\n  - Email: eric@blockjoy.com\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Team Size and Location:**\\\\\\\\n  - Whole Team: 13\\\\\\\\n  - Engineering Team: 9\\\\\\\\n  - Location: Global distributed with US headquarters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **Team Background and Bios:**\\\\\\\\nOur team consists of experienced professionals with a strong background in devops, blockchain technology and RPC infrastructure management. Key team members include:\\\\\\\\n- Chris Bruce, CEO - 5x Technical Founder, formerly Head of Product Development and Board of Directors at Helium, https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisabruce/\\\\\\\\n- Caleb Call, VP Infrastructure, formerly Head of Platform Engineering at Ripple, https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebcall/\\\\\\\\n- Matei Popa, Blockchain Reliability Engineer, previously Senior DevOps Engineer at CoW Protocol, https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateipopa/\\\\\\\\n- Cade Call, Blockchain Reliability Engineer, previously Lead DevOps Engineer at Medici Ventures, https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadecall/\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy started as one of the most successful Validators as a Service platforms on Helium and at one point was operating over 50% of the Helium network. Our services offered the best cost-to-performance ratio and had the highest ROI out of all the other providers.\\\\\\\\n- We later ran Helium\\\\\\\\u{2019}s entire public API. Consisting of over 30 clustered Postgres servers with 40TB of data each and 20 application servers (scaling as high as 100 when needed). We migrated Helium off AWS and ran everything in house on bare metal hardware. We implemented our own custom caching configuration, multi-region load balancing, and rate limiting. At its peak, we were handling over 300M requests/day. Additionally, we ran nearly 20 private APIs for companies like Binance, Crypto.com, Seed, and Nova Labs.\\\\\\\\n- Today we use the same custom built infrastructure to run over 500 nodes with support for over 30 protocols and adding new protocols and nodes weekly. We are currently serving nearly 2B rpc requests per month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Examples of Relevant Experience with Helium Blockchain Public RPC:**\\\\\\\\n- Operated Helium\\\\\\\\u{2019}s entire public API, in house on bare metal\\\\\\\\n- Operated the largest Validators as a Service for the Helium Network, 1600 validators\\\\\\\\n- Using our custom build infrastructure, we saved helium over $2M/year in operational costs\\\\\\\\n- Our Helium validators had the lowest cost and highest ROI out of the entire network\\\\\\\\n- Ran private Helium APIs for Binance, Crypto.com, Seed, and Nova Labs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Examples of Relevant Experience with NEAR Blockchain:**\\\\\\\\n- Integration of NEAR Blockchain to BlockVisor, enabling one-click deployment of high performance, unmetered RPC nodes to any server.  Features of Blockvisor include: one-click deployment, monitoring, alerting, logging on per node instance, efficient image upgrade and downgrade procedure, fast enrollment of new server to system, powerful management UX. All on bare metal servers resulting in lower costs and higher performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Main Appproach and Solution\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy has developed a purpose-built suite of tools designed specifically for operating and managing Blockchain Nodes on bare metal servers (servers running without virtual machines, docker, or kubernetes) without the mismatched Web2 tooling. These tools enable BlockJoy to run nodes in a highly performant manner resulting in higher throughput and lower operating costs than is typically seen on virtual machine and container based systems. Based on our experience, we can typically operate at 20% or less the cost of running on the cloud. Furthermore, we typically remove 3-5ms from response times of container based virtualization.\\\\\\\\n- For execution of this grant, we will utilize BlockJoy\\\\\\\\u{2019}s purpose-built node orchestration technology to efficiently handle node deployment, version updates, monitoring and alerting of full nodes and archive nodes. \\\\\\\\n- We will leverage our partnerships with several of the leading bare metal datacenter providers around the world for our bare metal servers and use best in class hardware (Gen4 AMD EPYC CPUs, NVMe5 disks, and a 10Gb network.) We strongly believe this helps to build a more diverse and resilient network that all protocols should be striving for. As a case in point, Hetzner, without notice, decided to pull the plug on all Solana validators running within their data centers, resulting in around 30% of solana\\\\\\\\u{2019}s validators going offline and triggering a huge token price crash. \\\\\\\\n- We will implement a robust load balancer to ensure high availability throughput and low latency. This system will incorporate global load balancing to efficiently route traffic to the nearest RPC nodes. We will establish rate limiting based on criteria such as URI, request volume across multiple time windows, upstream host capabilities, number of connections to the upstream host, response time, and IP address. Additionally, our solution will include caching specific calls to provide quicker response times. We will also conduct automatic health checks on upstream nodes to swiftly identify and replace any unhealthy nodes from the network, ensuring continuous and reliable service.\\\\\\\\n- We will implement a monitoring and alerting system that includes the following components:\\\\\\\\n  - External Synthetic Checks: Conducted from eight geographic locations to ensure nodes are operational and responding with expected results. Alerts will be triggered for failures such as non-200 responses, long response times, or unexpected responses.\\\\\\\\n  - Ping Checks: Performed on every host system to verify simple up/down status, with alerts issued if a system goes down.\\\\\\\\n  - Full System Metrics: Monitored for prolonged high CPU load, high memory usage, and low disk space, with alerts for any prolonged issues.\\\\\\\\n  - System and Blockchain Logs Collection: Alerts will be generated for error events, out-of-memory events, and blockchain-specific events as appropriate.\\\\\\\\n  - Full Blockchain Metrics Collection: Monitored from the client side, with alerts for RPC errors and other protocol-specific metrics.\\\\\\\\n  - Load Balancer Monitoring: Includes external synthetic checks from eight geographic locations to ensure functionality, with alerts for failures such as non-200 responses or unexpected results.\\\\\\\\n  - External-Facing Status Page: We will implement a nice looking custom status page utilizing a tool such as Atlassian Statuspage.\\\\\\\\n- We will implement a comprehensive security plan that includes robust DDoS protection via Cloudflare with IP whitelisting and blocking capabilities. We maintain detailed logging and monitoring with 13-month retention allowing for year-over-year analysis and behavior trends, utilizing the LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir). \\\\\\\\n- Disaster recovery will be addressed through our regular snapshot service.  We maintain nodes that are used to take regular snapshots, we then store multiple versions of those snapshots which allows us to quickly deploy new nodes.  This also allows us to scale very quickly as well if there are unexpected sustained surges in traffic.  In addition to maintaining snapshots, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve established strategic partnerships with Data Centers throughout the world maintaining strong relationships and ensuring we\\\\\\\\u{2019}re not reliant on any one hardware provider.\\\\\\\\n- BlockJoy\\\\\\\\\\\\'s SRE team will provide ad-hoc support on community forums, GitHub issues, and developer community channels such as Slack, Telegram, and Discord, with best-effort responses within 24-48 hours for generic services. We will assist in updating documentation for node operation on near.org.  Additionally, we will offer white-glove service support to facilitate the transition of high-priority overflow business, assisting in the migration of high-value users from public RPC to private NEAR RPC providers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why Choose This Project:**\\\\\\\\n- Our team offers proven expertise in high-performance RPC infrastructure, a strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture, and a commitment to decentralization and open-source principles.\\\\\\\\nWe believe in the philosophy of the Near token project and our founder has been a Near token holder long before the last Crypto crash.\\\\\\\\n- Our team has extensive experience in building and maintaining high-performance public RPC infrastructure on decentralized networks of bare metal servers for tier one blockchain networks such as Helium and Ripple. Additionally, we have on staff software developers constantly improving our tooling so our nodes can perform their best.\\\\\\\\n- We have a strong understanding of NEAR protocol architecture and technical specifications.\\\\\\\\n- We have a proven track record of handling high transaction volumes and ensuring low latency in a cost efficient manner.\\\\\\\\n- Lastly, our software is designed to run and manage blockchain nodes on any infrastructure. By distributing nodes across multiple bare metal vendors (instead of centralizing it to our own hardware) and not utilizing traditional Cloud companies, we help to make the Near Network more diverse and more resilient. \\\\\\\\n### Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n**Transition Timeline:**\\\\\\\\n- Nov 1st: Initial knowledge transfer and transition planning.

As NEAR continues to grow rapidly, it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s crucial to ensure that rpc.near.org provides a smooth and reliable onboarding experience while funneling advanced users to production-grade services. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s decentralized RPC network enhances speed and reliability, drives user engagement and maximizes retention. It provides redundancy and scalability by aggregating and optimizing top providers (e.g. Nodies, Liquify, All That Node, Chainstack, FastNEAR) alongside community contributors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have to spend resources on writing RFPs, debating proposals and technical specs, just to choose a single provider. By partnering with Lava, NEAR chooses to distribute its *infra budget to providers that offer the best service* in practice, based on real usage, uptime and performance. \\\\\\\\nThe majority of the budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava, and it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s distributed to top providers and NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Lava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 233,000 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Here wallet, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake and more\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Performance:\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiai44wnbwgqlwz373446j5giz43tn7do4u7vcfbhlfkjuozqp76ve](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiai44wnbwgqlwz373446j5giz43tn7do4u7vcfbhlfkjuozqp76ve)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique features:\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers -** automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution -** transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses -** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust -** aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page -** showing health, usage and performance metrics, \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Security\\\\\\\\n1. Security Measures:\\\\\\\\n- Comprehensive DDoS protection via Cloudflare, IP whitelisting, and 95-day log retention with detailed monitoring.\\\\\\\\n- 24/7 proactive monitoring and response team to ensure 100% uptime and quick incident management.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Disaster Recovery Plan:\\\\\\\\n- Our globally distributed infrastructure, with servers strategically placed across multiple regions, ensures minimized downtime and complete mitigation of outages.\\\\\\\\n- Each region is equipped with failover load balancing, providing seamless service continuity even during localized failures.

We will happily set up dedicated support channels for NEAR <> Lava users. We aim to respond to issues significantly faster than the standard 24-48 hour timeframe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bitte:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of Mintbase Wallet, resulting in fewer user complaints. **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The support from the Lava team has been exceptional, with their quick responses making a real difference.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Dragonbot:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been using Lava for our trading bot and were pleasantly surprised by the performance and low integration cost. Switching from our previous provider to Lava proved to be a great decision. **Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Updates and Changes\\\\\\\\nLava will update its RPC specifications in line with nearcore updates, and collaborate with providers to ensure smooth upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transparent status page\\\\\\\\nLava will provide an openly available real-time status page where anyone can monitor the health and usage stats of rpc.near.org - including availability, performance, geolocation distribution, common queries, rate-limit enforcement, dapp usage, and the transition from public to private RPC.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA sneak preview of the new dashboard :)\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie2ch35rz5k5pq7eenxndy67py2qllhu7chsowcruz7feauxjpg7m](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie2ch35rz5k5pq7eenxndy67py2qllhu7chsowcruz7feauxjpg7m)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreidg52g7etbckr2dksubku5ei6yiml653oavva3px23ygfnfad2ymq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreidg52g7etbckr2dksubku5ei6yiml653oavva3px23ygfnfad2ymq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway (and NEAR Docs), where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava will accelerate rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\u{2019}s transition to a demo environment and NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Rate limits\\\\\\\\nWe analyzed data from our network which serves %50 of rpc.near.org traffic, and traffic from users on Ref, Burrow, Bitte, Sender, Meteor and more. \\\\\\\\n**We propose a data-driven approach to enforcing new rate limits:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiery4nwgratznmprpfvhdame34hhlbtfd4zvrqtva56byfcjxscnu](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiery4nwgratznmprpfvhdame34hhlbtfd4zvrqtva56byfcjxscnu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigseauigdcc4pp2awpw4utepefxgvllxd3seg7xhdecazso44hbfa](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigseauigdcc4pp2awpw4utepefxgvllxd3seg7xhdecazso44hbfa)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Observations:\\\\\\\\n - Changing the rate-limit to 5 req/sec (RPS) will force 65-71% of users to drop, removing 99% of traffic from rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Changing the rate-limit to 50-100 RPS will impact ~20% of users who are responsible for ~70% of traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Recommendations:\\\\\\\\nDevelopers in the NEAR ecosystem are used to having almost no limits on rpc.near.org. While that created some challenges, it also made it easier for dapps to thrive and innovate on NEAR.\\\\\\\\nRestricting access too much or too quickly might hurt many users and builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**We recommend moving forward with a more moderate transition:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t1. Current limit: 900 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t2. November: Lava inherits rpc.near.org operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t3. January: 500 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t4. February: 250 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t5. March: 100 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t6. April-October: 50 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will closely monitor critical metrics (listed below) and collaborate with builders and the NEAR Infra Committee to find an optimal balance. Our goal is to allow early-stage developers to build freely while maintaining a clear path to upgrading as their projects grow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget breakdown\\\\\\\\n**Total budget - $304,600 in NEAR for the first year**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Transition and Setup - $10,000**\\\\\\\\n- Transfer and testing of rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Adding ReadRPC to Lava\\\\\\\\n- Onboarding more top providers\\\\\\\\n- Deploying additional servers for redundancy\\\\\\\\n- Statistics dashboard\\\\\\\\n- User and provider docs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. RPC Incentives - $30,000 / month until March (including), $15,000 / month from April**\\\\\\\\n- RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n- Archive nodes increasing costs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Support & maintenance: 4,000$ / month until March (including), $2,800 / month from April**\\\\\\\\n- Hardware\\\\\\\\n- Devops\\\\\\\\n- User support\\\\\\\\n- Provider support\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n**1.

From 50% of traffic handled by Lava to 100% in a few days\\\\\\\\n- Knowledge transfer including ReadRPC\\\\\\\\n- Onboard top providers\\\\\\\\n- Launch marketing campaign\\\\\\\\n- Launch public statistics dashboard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Milestone 3 (February 2025): Transitioning rpc.near.org to a demo environment**\\\\\\\\n- Multi-chain API subscriptions campaign\\\\\\\\n- Complete rate-limit roadmap\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Contingency\\\\\\\\nOur pricing uses Compute Units, which range from 10 to 200 according to the intensity and resources required to perform different queries. Looking at our current NEAR usage, the average ration is 16.34 CUs/Query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the current usage stats, rpc.near.org serves ~26B monthly requests, assuming base traffic is 10,000 RPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe ask for $1.634 for every 1M requests above 26B monthly requests / $0.1 for every 1 million monthly Compute Units beyond 425 billion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n**1. Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n- Uptime\\\\\\\\n- Latency\\\\\\\\n- Data freshness\\\\\\\\n- Success rate\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n- Total traffic\\\\\\\\n- Active users\\\\\\\\n- 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n- Referred traffic from rpc.near.org to gateway.lavanet.xyz and https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n- Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Organization\\\\\\\\nLava Foundation is a non-profit entity representing Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s token holders and DAO, leading the vision and development of Lava Network.

By partnering with Lava, NEAR chooses to distribute its *infra budget to providers that offer the best service* in practice, based on real usage, uptime and performance. \\\\\\\\nThe majority of the budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava, and it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s distributed to top providers and NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Lava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 233,000 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Here wallet, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake and more\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Performance:\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiai44wnbwgqlwz373446j5giz43tn7do4u7vcfbhlfkjuozqp76ve](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiai44wnbwgqlwz373446j5giz43tn7do4u7vcfbhlfkjuozqp76ve)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique features:\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers -** automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution -** transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses -** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust -** aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page -** showing health, usage and performance metrics, \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Security\\\\\\\\n1. Security Measures:\\\\\\\\n- Comprehensive DDoS protection via Cloudflare, IP whitelisting, and 95-day log retention with detailed monitoring.\\\\\\\\n- 24/7 proactive monitoring and response team to ensure 100% uptime and quick incident management.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Disaster Recovery Plan:\\\\\\\\n- Our globally distributed infrastructure, with servers strategically placed across multiple regions, ensures minimized downtime and complete mitigation of outages.\\\\\\\\n- Each region is equipped with failover load balancing, providing seamless service continuity even during localized failures. Regular backups further reinforce our ability to restore services quickly and efficiently, always ensuring uninterrupted operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Compliance and Data Integrity:\\\\\\\\n- Adherence to data consistency standards, with transparent communication during service changes or disruptions. Our infrastructure ensures high security and compliance.\\\\\\\\n- Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s RPC serves five-time epochs and tracks all NEAR shards. It also offers an advanced data integrity mechanism that samples and cross-references RPC responses to detect and prevent inaccurate data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreement\\\\\\\\nOur current services meet the RFP requirements with:\\\\\\\\n- Uptime: 100% over the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- Average latency: 185ms across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo further improve our SLA, we will:\\\\\\\\n- Deploy additional gateways in main regions (endpoints)\\\\\\\\n- Onboard more top providers\\\\\\\\n- Integrate readrpc\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Support\\\\\\\\nWe currently support the NEAR community through both public and private channels. We will happily set up dedicated support channels for NEAR <> Lava users. We aim to respond to issues significantly faster than the standard 24-48 hour timeframe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bitte:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of Mintbase Wallet, resulting in fewer user complaints. **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The support from the Lava team has been exceptional, with their quick responses making a real difference.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Dragonbot:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been using Lava for our trading bot and were pleasantly surprised by the performance and low integration cost. Switching from our previous provider to Lava proved to be a great decision. **Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Updates and Changes\\\\\\\\nLava will update its RPC specifications in line with nearcore updates, and collaborate with providers to ensure smooth upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transparent status page\\\\\\\\nLava will provide an openly available real-time status page where anyone can monitor the health and usage stats of rpc.near.org - including availability, performance, geolocation distribution, common queries, rate-limit enforcement, dapp usage, and the transition from public to private RPC.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA sneak preview of the new dashboard :)\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie2ch35rz5k5pq7eenxndy67py2qllhu7chsowcruz7feauxjpg7m](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie2ch35rz5k5pq7eenxndy67py2qllhu7chsowcruz7feauxjpg7m)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreidg52g7etbckr2dksubku5ei6yiml653oavva3px23ygfnfad2ymq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreidg52g7etbckr2dksubku5ei6yiml653oavva3px23ygfnfad2ymq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway (and NEAR Docs), where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava will accelerate rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\u{2019}s transition to a demo environment and NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Rate limits\\\\\\\\nWe analyzed data from our network which serves %50 of rpc.near.org traffic, and traffic from users on Ref, Burrow, Bitte, Sender, Meteor and more. \\\\\\\\n**We propose a data-driven approach to enforcing new rate limits:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiery4nwgratznmprpfvhdame34hhlbtfd4zvrqtva56byfcjxscnu](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiery4nwgratznmprpfvhdame34hhlbtfd4zvrqtva56byfcjxscnu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigseauigdcc4pp2awpw4utepefxgvllxd3seg7xhdecazso44hbfa](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigseauigdcc4pp2awpw4utepefxgvllxd3seg7xhdecazso44hbfa)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Observations:\\\\\\\\n - Changing the rate-limit to 5 req/sec (RPS) will force 65-71% of users to drop, removing 99% of traffic from rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Changing the rate-limit to 50-100 RPS will impact ~20% of users who are responsible for ~70% of traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Recommendations:\\\\\\\\nDevelopers in the NEAR ecosystem are used to having almost no limits on rpc.near.org. While that created some challenges, it also made it easier for dapps to thrive and innovate on NEAR.\\\\\\\\nRestricting access too much or too quickly might hurt many users and builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**We recommend moving forward with a more moderate transition:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t1. Current limit: 900 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t2. November: Lava inherits rpc.near.org operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t3. January: 500 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t4. February: 250 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t5. March: 100 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t6. April-October: 50 RPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will closely monitor critical metrics (listed below) and collaborate with builders and the NEAR Infra Committee to find an optimal balance. Our goal is to allow early-stage developers to build freely while maintaining a clear path to upgrading as their projects grow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget breakdown\\\\\\\\n**Total budget - $304,600 in NEAR for the first year**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1.
