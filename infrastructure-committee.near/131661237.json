This success, however, has also led to a significant increase in operational costs borne by our community of providers, who manage RPC and Archive nodes, supporting 6M+ weekly NEAR users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Lava was not selected as the new operator for rpc.near.org, we face a funding gap while still running infra to support a substantial portion of the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to continue supporting NEAR and transition our users to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s premium offering, where their usage will not be subsidized by NEAR Foundation. To ensure a smooth transition, we ask for a 6-month extension of our existing funding. This will allow us to keep maintaining our existing traffic and quality of service and pay providers for their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal outlines how Lava will shift high-usage RPC clients to a paid subscription model. By the end of this 6-month period, we expect most NEAR applications to be self-sustaining, covering the costs of their infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How Lava Works\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s decentralized RPC network enhances speed and reliability, drives user engagement, and maximizes retention. It provides redundancy and scalability by aggregating and optimizing top providers (e.g., Nodies, Liquify, All That Node, Chainstack, FastNEAR) alongside community contributors. The budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava; rather, it is distributed to top providers and NEAR community contributors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Lava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n**- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 1,066,143 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake, and more\\\\\\\\n### Performance\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique Features\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers** - automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution** - transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust** - aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page** - showing health, usage, and performance metrics\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway, where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nBy working with Calimero, NEAR HZN, DevHub, Keypom, Build DAO, and Frontier Growth, and offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s endpoint will transition to a demo environment that connects between NEAR and other blockchains, strengthening NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nAlongside rpc.near.org, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public and premium RPC remains a major, decentralized entry point to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget** - 18,000 NEAR for 6 months.\\\\\\\\n  The entire budget will be committed to incentivizing top RPC and archive providers, waiving Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s costs for infra, support, marketing, etc.\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1:** Signing of agreement\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 2:** Transitioning key services to premium services\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n1. **Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n  - Uptime\\\\\\\\n  - Latency\\\\\\\\n  - Data freshness\\\\\\\\n  - Success rate\\\\\\\\n2. **Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n  - Total traffic\\\\\\\\n  - Active users\\\\\\\\n  - 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n  - Referred traffic from near.lava.build to gateway.lavanet.xyz (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n  - Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of Relevant Work\\\\\\\\nLava has 3 years of experience building and maintaining robust RPC systems for blockchains and enterprises, specializing in boosting ecosystem-wide user experiences.\\\\\\\\nOur customers and partners include NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Union, Axelar, Evmos, Cosmos, and many more will be announced soon.\\\\\\\\nAs the official RPC provider for Axelar, Evmos, and Cosmos Hub, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve maintained 100% uptime over the last 6 months, and an average latency of 170ms at high-throughput environments.\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669)\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745)\\\\\\\\n### NEAR Experience\\\\\\\\nLava is the go-to RPC service in the ecosystem, chosen by leading teams like Pagoda, Ref & Burrow, Bitte, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Dragonbot, Sender Wallet, Allstake, and more. Through close collaboration with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda, and by leveraging Lava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized tech, we have significantly enhanced the reliability of on-chain activities.\\\\\\\\n- **Solving \\\\\\\\\\\\'node does not track shard-id\\\\\\\\\\\\' errors**\\\\\\\\n  Lava implemented a retry mechanism that automatically redirects queries to alternative providers when failures occur. This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n- **Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\n  By identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## In-House Resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n- **Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos. Their innovative approach of decentralizing RPC endpoints via incentivization has notably improved the stability, quality, and visibility or RPC services on the Evmos chain.

This success, however, has also led to a significant increase in operational costs borne by our community of providers, who manage RPC and Archive nodes, supporting 6M+ weekly NEAR users.\\\\\\\\nSince Lava was not selected as the new operator for rpc.near.org, we face a funding gap while still running infra to support a substantial portion of the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to continue supporting NEAR and transition our users to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s premium offering, where their usage will not be subsidized by NEAR Foundation. To ensure a smooth transition, we ask for a 6-month extension of our existing funding. This will allow us to keep maintaining our existing traffic and quality of service and pay providers for their work.\\\\\\\\nThis proposal outlines how Lava will shift high-usage RPC clients to a paid subscription model. By the end of this 6-month period, we expect most NEAR applications to be self-sustaining, covering the costs of their infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n### How Lava Works\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s decentralized RPC network enhances speed and reliability, drives user engagement, and maximizes retention. It provides redundancy and scalability by aggregating and optimizing top providers (e.g., Nodies, Liquify, All That Node, Chainstack, FastNEAR) alongside community contributors.\\\\\\\\nThe budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava; rather, it is distributed to top providers and NEAR community contributors.\\\\\\\\nLava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 1,066,143 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake, and more\\\\\\\\n### Performance\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique Features\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers** - automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution** - transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust** - aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page** - showing health, usage, and performance metrics\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway, where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nBy working with Calimero, NEAR HZN, DevHub, Keypom, Build DAO, and Frontier Growth, and offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s endpoint will transition to a demo environment that connects between NEAR and other blockchains, strengthening NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nAlongside rpc.near.org, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public and premium RPC remains a major, decentralized entry point to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget** - 18,000 NEAR for 6 months.\\\\\\\\n  The entire budget will be committed to incentivizing top RPC and archive providers, waiving Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s costs for infra, support, marketing, etc.\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1:** Signing of agreement\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 2:** Transitioning key services to premium services\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n- **Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n  - Uptime\\\\\\\\n  - Latency\\\\\\\\n  - Data freshness\\\\\\\\n  - Success rate\\\\\\\\n- **Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n  - Total traffic\\\\\\\\n  - Active users\\\\\\\\n  - 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n  - Referred traffic from near.lava.build to gateway.lavanet.xyz (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n  - Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of Relevant Work\\\\\\\\nLava has 3 years of experience building and maintaining robust RPC systems for blockchains and enterprises, specializing in boosting ecosystem-wide user experiences.\\\\\\\\nOur customers and partners include NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Union, Axelar, Evmos, Cosmos, and many more will be announced soon.\\\\\\\\nAs the official RPC provider for Axelar, Evmos, and Cosmos Hub, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve maintained 100% uptime over the last 6 months, and an average latency of 170ms at high-throughput environments.\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669)\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745)\\\\\\\\n### NEAR Experience\\\\\\\\nLava is the go-to RPC service in the ecosystem, chosen by leading teams like Pagoda, Ref & Burrow, Bitte, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Dragonbot, Sender Wallet, Allstake, and more. Through close collaboration with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda, and by leveraging Lava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized tech, we have significantly enhanced the reliability of on-chain activities.\\\\\\\\n- **Solving \\\\\\\\\\\\'node does not track shard-id\\\\\\\\\\\\' errors**\\\\\\\\n  Lava implemented a retry mechanism that automatically redirects queries to alternative providers when failures occur. This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n- **Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\n  By identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## In-House Resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n- **Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos.

Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nBy working with Calimero, NEAR HZN, DevHub, Keypom, Build DAO, and Frontier Growth, and offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s endpoint will transition to a demo environment that connects between NEAR and other blockchains, strengthening NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nAlongside rpc.near.org, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public and premium RPC remains a major, decentralized entry point to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget** - 18,000 NEAR for 6 months.\\\\\\\\n  The entire budget will be committed to incentivizing top RPC and archive providers, waiving Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s costs for infra, support, marketing, etc.\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1:** Signing of agreement\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 2:** Transitioning key services to premium services\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n- **Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n  - Uptime\\\\\\\\n  - Latency\\\\\\\\n  - Data freshness\\\\\\\\n  - Success rate\\\\\\\\n- **Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n  - Total traffic\\\\\\\\n  - Active users\\\\\\\\n  - 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n  - Referred traffic from near.lava.build to gateway.lavanet.xyz (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n  - Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of Relevant Work\\\\\\\\nLava has 3 years of experience building and maintaining robust RPC systems for blockchains and enterprises, specializing in boosting ecosystem-wide user experiences.\\\\\\\\nOur customers and partners include NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Union, Axelar, Evmos, Cosmos, and many more will be announced soon.\\\\\\\\nAs the official RPC provider for Axelar, Evmos, and Cosmos Hub, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve maintained 100% uptime over the last 6 months, and an average latency of 170ms at high-throughput environments.\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669)\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745)\\\\\\\\n### NEAR Experience\\\\\\\\nLava is the go-to RPC service in the ecosystem, chosen by leading teams like Pagoda, Ref & Burrow, Bitte, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Dragonbot, Sender Wallet, Allstake, and more. Through close collaboration with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda, and by leveraging Lava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized tech, we have significantly enhanced the reliability of on-chain activities.\\\\\\\\n- **Solving \\\\\\\\\\\\'node does not track shard-id\\\\\\\\\\\\' errors**\\\\\\\\n  Lava implemented a retry mechanism that automatically redirects queries to alternative providers when failures occur. This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n- **Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\n  By identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## In-House Resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n- **Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos. Their innovative approach of decentralizing RPC endpoints via incentivization has notably improved the stability, quality, and visibility or RPC services on the Evmos chain. We appreciate Lava for their significant contributions to the project\\\\\\\\u{2019}s success.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- **Ref Finance:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a crucial partner for Ref and Burrow Finance. We rely on their endpoint as the default RPC for our products and have been extremely satisfied with their performance, stability, and support. Since integrating Lava, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve experienced a noticeable reduction in errors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Bitte:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of Mintbase Wallet, resulting in fewer user complaints. The support from the Lava team has been exceptional, with their quick responses making a real difference.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Dragonbot:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been using Lava for our trading bot and were pleasantly surprised by the performance and low integration cost. Switching from our previous provider to Lava proved to be a great decision. Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **ShardDog:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack. As usage grows but we stay as a small team, we need reliable infra to handle the scaling. Since adding this to our front-end and back-end APIs, it has allowed us to focus on improving our product instead of the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Organization\\\\\\\\nLava Foundation is a non-profit entity representing Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s token holders and DAO, leading the vision and development of Lava Network.

This success, however, has also led to a significant increase in operational costs borne by our community of providers, who manage RPC and Archive nodes, supporting 6M+ weekly NEAR users.\\\\\\\\nSince Lava was not selected as the new operator for rpc.near.org, we face a funding gap while still running infra to support a substantial portion of the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to continue supporting NEAR and transition our users to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s premium offering, where their usage will not be subsidized by NEAR Foundation. To ensure a smooth transition, we ask for a 6-month extension of our existing funding. This will allow us to keep maintaining our existing traffic and quality of service and pay providers for their work.\\\\\\\\nThis proposal outlines how Lava will shift high-usage RPC clients to a paid subscription model. By the end of this 6-month period, we expect most NEAR applications to be self-sustaining, covering the costs of their infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n### How Lava Works\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s decentralized RPC network enhances speed and reliability, drives user engagement, and maximizes retention. It provides redundancy and scalability by aggregating and optimizing top providers (e.g., Nodies, Liquify, All That Node, Chainstack, FastNEAR) alongside community contributors.\\\\\\\\nThe budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava; rather, it is distributed to top providers and NEAR community contributors.\\\\\\\\nLava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 1,066,143 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake, and more\\\\\\\\n### Performance\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique Features\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers** - automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution** - transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust** - aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page** - showing health, usage, and performance metrics\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway, where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nBy working with Calimero, NEAR HZN, DevHub, Keypom, Build DAO, and Frontier Growth, and offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s endpoint will transition to a demo environment that connects between NEAR and other blockchains, strengthening NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nAlongside rpc.near.org, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public and premium RPC remains a major, decentralized entry point to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget** - 18,000 NEAR for 6 months.\\\\\\\\n  The entire budget will be committed to incentivizing top RPC and archive providers, waiving Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s costs for infra, support, marketing, etc.\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1:** Signing of agreement\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 2:** Transitioning key services to premium services\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n- **Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n  - Uptime\\\\\\\\n  - Latency\\\\\\\\n  - Data freshness\\\\\\\\n  - Success rate\\\\\\\\n- **Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n  - Total traffic\\\\\\\\n  - Active users\\\\\\\\n  - 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n  - Referred traffic from near.lava.build to gateway.lavanet.xyz (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n  - Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of Relevant Work\\\\\\\\nLava has 3 years of experience building and maintaining robust RPC systems for blockchains and enterprises, specializing in boosting ecosystem-wide user experiences.\\\\\\\\nOur customers and partners include NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Union, Axelar, Evmos, Cosmos, and many more will be announced soon.\\\\\\\\nAs the official RPC provider for Axelar, Evmos, and Cosmos Hub, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve maintained 100% uptime over the last 6 months, and an average latency of 170ms at high-throughput environments.\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669)\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745)\\\\\\\\n### NEAR Experience\\\\\\\\nLava is the go-to RPC service in the ecosystem, chosen by leading teams like Pagoda, Ref & Burrow, Bitte, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Dragonbot, Sender Wallet, Allstake, and more. Through close collaboration with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda, and by leveraging Lava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized tech, we have significantly enhanced the reliability of on-chain activities.\\\\\\\\n- **Solving \\\\\\\\\\\\'node does not track shard-id\\\\\\\\\\\\' errors**\\\\\\\\n  Lava implemented a retry mechanism that automatically redirects queries to alternative providers when failures occur. This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n- **Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\n  By identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## In-House Resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n- **Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos. Their innovative approach of decentralizing RPC endpoints via incentivization has notably improved the stability, quality, and visibility or RPC services on the Evmos chain. We appreciate Lava for their significant contributions to the project\\\\\\\\u{2019}s success.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- **Ref Finance:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a crucial partner for Ref and Burrow Finance. We rely on their endpoint as the default RPC for our products and have been extremely satisfied with their performance, stability, and support. Since integrating Lava, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve experienced a noticeable reduction in errors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Bitte:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of Mintbase Wallet, resulting in fewer user complaints. The support from the Lava team has been exceptional, with their quick responses making a real difference.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Dragonbot:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been using Lava for our trading bot and were pleasantly surprised by the performance and low integration cost. Switching from our previous provider to Lava proved to be a great decision. Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **ShardDog:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack.

This success, however, has also led to a significant increase in operational costs borne by our community of providers, who manage RPC and Archive nodes, supporting 6M+ weekly NEAR users.\\\\\\\\nSince Lava was not selected as the new operator for rpc.near.org, we face a funding gap while still running infra to support a substantial portion of the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to continue supporting NEAR and transition our users to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s premium offering, where their usage will not be subsidized by NEAR Foundation. To ensure a smooth transition, we ask for a 6-month extension of our existing funding. This will allow us to keep maintaining our existing traffic and quality of service and pay providers for their work.\\\\\\\\nThis proposal outlines how Lava will shift high-usage RPC clients to a paid subscription model. By the end of this 6-month period, we expect most NEAR applications to be self-sustaining, covering the costs of their infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n### How Lava Works\\\\\\\\nLava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s decentralized RPC network enhances speed and reliability, drives user engagement, and maximizes retention. It provides redundancy and scalability by aggregating and optimizing top providers (e.g., Nodies, Liquify, All That Node, Chainstack, FastNEAR) alongside community contributors.\\\\\\\\nThe budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava; rather, it is distributed to top providers and NEAR community contributors.\\\\\\\\nLava is the primary RPC provider for NEAR, achieving significant milestones this year:\\\\\\\\n- Managing 50% of the traffic on rpc.near.org\\\\\\\\n- Serving 1,066,143 unique daily users on NEAR\\\\\\\\n- Handling over 43 billion NEAR RPC requests, 10B every month\\\\\\\\n- Powering leading dApps such as: Ref Finance, Burrow Finance, Bitte Protocol, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Sender, Dragonbot, SHITZU, Allstake, and more\\\\\\\\n### Performance\\\\\\\\n- 100% uptime in the last 6 months\\\\\\\\n- 185ms average latency across all regions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifwu4rukg2mbtfpv3o2stn6aqwzn5mbtjgg2zgcmkxss4vkuwpvhq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Unique Features\\\\\\\\nOur highest goal is to ensure seamless UX. Users who access NEAR through Lava are connected with the best providers in their geolocation based on uptime, latency, and data freshness. If a provider fails to respond or returns an error, the user automatically switches to another provider without any manual effort or noticing the change.\\\\\\\\n- **0 Errors for developers** - automatic fallback and retry before errors reach the end user\\\\\\\\n- **Faster TX execution** - transactions are sent to many providers at once, resulting in faster propagation and execution for end users\\\\\\\\n- **Instant responses** on common and recent requests through smart cache\\\\\\\\n- **Super reliable and robust** - aggregating top RPC providers on a single endpoint\\\\\\\\n- **Public stats page** - showing health, usage, and performance metrics\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Transition to Demo Environment\\\\\\\\nUsers exceeding rate limits will be redirected to Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Gateway, where they can purchase API subscriptions. Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s subscriptions include NEAR and 30+ other networks, making it very attractive for developers interested in using NEAR for Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nBy working with Calimero, NEAR HZN, DevHub, Keypom, Build DAO, and Frontier Growth, and offering special discounts on multi-chain data access, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s endpoint will transition to a demo environment that connects between NEAR and other blockchains, strengthening NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s alignment with Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\nAlongside rpc.near.org, Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public and premium RPC remains a major, decentralized entry point to the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Budget & Milestones\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget** - 18,000 NEAR for 6 months.\\\\\\\\n  The entire budget will be committed to incentivizing top RPC and archive providers, waiving Lava\\\\\\\\u{2019}s costs for infra, support, marketing, etc.\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1:** Signing of agreement\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 2:** Transitioning key services to premium services\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\nWe will track the following metrics to measure success across two key areas:\\\\\\\\n- **Quality of service**\\\\\\\\n  - Uptime\\\\\\\\n  - Latency\\\\\\\\n  - Data freshness\\\\\\\\n  - Success rate\\\\\\\\n- **Transition to demo environment**\\\\\\\\n  - Total traffic\\\\\\\\n  - Active users\\\\\\\\n  - 429 Errors\\\\\\\\n  - Referred traffic from near.lava.build to gateway.lavanet.xyz (UTMs)\\\\\\\\n  - Subscription purchases\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of Relevant Work\\\\\\\\nLava has 3 years of experience building and maintaining robust RPC systems for blockchains and enterprises, specializing in boosting ecosystem-wide user experiences.\\\\\\\\nOur customers and partners include NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Union, Axelar, Evmos, Cosmos, and many more will be announced soon.\\\\\\\\nAs the official RPC provider for Axelar, Evmos, and Cosmos Hub, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve maintained 100% uptime over the last 6 months, and an average latency of 170ms at high-throughput environments.\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1823373406513090669)\\\\\\\\n- [https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745](https://x.com/lavanetxyz/status/1832092166773944745)\\\\\\\\n### NEAR Experience\\\\\\\\nLava is the go-to RPC service in the ecosystem, chosen by leading teams like Pagoda, Ref & Burrow, Bitte, Meteor, NEAR Mobile, Dragonbot, Sender Wallet, Allstake, and more. Through close collaboration with NEAR Foundation and Pagoda, and by leveraging Lava\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized tech, we have significantly enhanced the reliability of on-chain activities.\\\\\\\\n- **Solving \\\\\\\\\\\\'node does not track shard-id\\\\\\\\\\\\' errors**\\\\\\\\n  Lava implemented a retry mechanism that automatically redirects queries to alternative providers when failures occur. This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n- **Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\n  By identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n## In-House Resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n- **Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos. Their innovative approach of decentralizing RPC endpoints via incentivization has notably improved the stability, quality, and visibility or RPC services on the Evmos chain. We appreciate Lava for their significant contributions to the project\\\\\\\\u{2019}s success.\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- **Ref Finance:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a crucial partner for Ref and Burrow Finance. We rely on their endpoint as the default RPC for our products and have been extremely satisfied with their performance, stability, and support. Since integrating Lava, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve experienced a noticeable reduction in errors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Bitte:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since integrating Lava RPC, we have seen a significant improvement in the performance of Mintbase Wallet, resulting in fewer user complaints. The support from the Lava team has been exceptional, with their quick responses making a real difference.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **Dragonbot:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been using Lava for our trading bot and were pleasantly surprised by the performance and low integration cost. Switching from our previous provider to Lava proved to be a great decision. Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- **ShardDog:**\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u{201c}At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack. As usage grows but we stay as a small team, we need reliable infra to handle the scaling.
