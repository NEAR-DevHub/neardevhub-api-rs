There are two common types of nodes:\\\\\\\\n- RPC nodes (as well as validator nodes)\\\\\\\\n- Archive nodes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRPC nodes keep track of all headers and the last N epochs of blocks data. RPC nodes usually require fast NVME SSD disk(s) to keep all data in order to be able to keep up with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArchive nodes keep track of all headers and all blocks data. Archive nodes split state into hot-data and cold-data. The hot-data requires an NVME SSD disk, while cold-data can be kept on the HDDs array. Note, that an archive node with hdd version is not practical for quick RPC queries against older data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo synchronize a nearcore node, the operator usually uses a data snapshot from another synchronized nearcore node and then catches up with the head of the network. This process is much faster than synchronizing the blockchain from the beginning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal is focusing on providing snapshots to the community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Previous state\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, the snapshots were provided by Pagoda and were served from AWS S3 and/or Cloudfront. S3 has a per GB egress cost associated with downloads. Cloudfront price depends on total monthly usage and varies from $30 to $120 per TB, and since regular RPC snapshots are around 1.6 TB, the cost of every RPC download may result in $150.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA mainnet archive snapshot, contains about 62Tb of data. So a single download at $60 per TB costs $3,720.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe storage on S3 is around $22 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the nodes are operated in the AWS, then upload to S3 is free, but if the nodes are hosted outside (e.g. on GCP), then there is a cost associated with uploading data, which for GCP may be around $45 to $90 per TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the current monthly size of S3 bucket to be around 500-700TB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe egress costs may be the highest contributing factor! The egress also increases during resharding events and protocol upgrades (e.g. `2.0.0` release), when some validators fail to upgrade and are forced to sync from the snapshots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe estimate the previous infrastructure cost to be from $30,000 to $90,000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Solution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s solution is to leverage Cloudflare\\\\\\\\u{2019}s R2 instead of S3, which has no associated egress cost, but instead it is charged based on amount of data stored and number of times each file is accessed. R2 also has lower storage cost per GB than AWS S3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- R2 storage cost per TB is $15 per month.\\\\\\\\n- R2 write costs are $4.5 per 1,000,000 Operations A (usually write, list, etc.)\\\\\\\\n- R2 access cost is $0.36 per 1,000,000 Operations B (which includes read and head requests).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince R2 doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t provide a public S3 endpoint, the snapshots will be accessible through HTTPS using a list of snapshot files in a separate file. It can be downloaded using `rclone` in parallel using one of the provided script, e.g. https://github.com/fastnear/static/blob/main/down_rclone.sh\\\\\\\\nThis setup supports downloading snapshot\\\\\\\\u{2019}s data at high bandwidth by leveraging Cloudflare caching and edge network.\\\\\\\\nWe plan to add md5 verification to verify files integrity and automatically retry downloads for malformed files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Snapshot process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe leverage BTRFS to be able to create a just-in-time snapshot of a storage on the node to decrease downtime of the node. On our proof-of-concept we were able to achieve close to 10Gbps upload speed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimplified process:\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the node\\\\\\\\n2. Snapshot the data using BTRFS\\\\\\\\n3. Start the node\\\\\\\\n4. Generate the file list and md5 hashes\\\\\\\\n5. Upload files to R2\\\\\\\\n6. Upload the file list\\\\\\\\n7. Update list of available snapshots\\\\\\\\n8. Update the latest available snapshot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Snapshots\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFASTNEAR to provide snapshots at the following frequency:\\\\\\\\n- RPC for both mainnet and testnet:\\\\\\\\n    - 1 snapshot with 5 epochs per day with the retention of 30 days\\\\\\\\n    - (Mainnet only) 3 snapshots with 3 epochs per day with the retention of 2 days \\\\\\\\n- Archive for both mainnet and testnet:\\\\\\\\n    - 1 hot-data per day with the retention of 30 days\\\\\\\\n    - 1 cold-data per **week** with the retention of 30 days (about 4 snapshots per month)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Sizing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Mainnet snapshots:\\\\\\\\n    - RPC/Hot-data with 5 epochs: 1.7Tb\\\\\\\\n    - RPC with 3 epochs: 1.3Tb\\\\\\\\n    - Cold-data: 60Tb\\\\\\\\n- Testnet snapshots:\\\\\\\\n    - RPC/Hot-data with 5 epochs: 0.6Tb\\\\\\\\n    - Cold-data: 11Tb\\\\\\\\n- Expected growth: 6% per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent Total: ~432Tb / month\\\\\\\\nFile count: ~8,863,744 files per month (based on 64Mb p per file and ignoring retention)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Nodes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo operate the service we need one main node and one backup node per snapshot type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRequirements:\\\\\\\\n* 10Gbps connection\\\\\\\\n* Only NVME disks (HDDs are too slow for upload and catch ups)\\\\\\\\n* Expected traffic 100Tb+ for RPC, 400Tb+ for archive node (mainnet)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal 8 nodes, see budget breakdown for details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Setup of the nodes\\\\\\\\n- Development of scripts and tools to generate snapshots\\\\\\\\n- Monitoring and alerts\\\\\\\\n- Publish snapshots at the schedule\\\\\\\\n- Documentation how to download snapshots from the new source\\\\\\\\n- Update near-nodes.io to point to the new solution\\\\\\\\n- Deprecate the legacy S3 solution\\\\\\\\n- A custom documentation website that dynamically provides links to the snapshots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n- Uptime - not missing scheduled snapshots.\\\\\\\\n- Upload speed - how long it takes to publish a snapshot.

With our extensive experience in indexing and integration, we are well-positioned to ensure a seamless transition for KitWallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Response to Requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt Nearblocks.io, we have already created drop-in replaceable KitWallet endpoints, which means there will be no need to build additional infrastructure. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA transition plan would simply be updating `https://api.kitwallet.app/` to `https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/kitwallet/`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis gives us a distinct advantage in terms of efficiency and speed for this transition. Our ongoing communication with members of the Pagoda team & infrastructure committee further reinforces our commitment to staying aligned with the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks is built on top of Near Lake as the data source and currently operates as the #1 explorer within the ecosystem. We believe Nearblocks is in the best position to support this transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Current live endpoints (documentation):**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Mainnet: https://api.nearblocks.io/api-docs/#/Kitwallet\\\\\\\\n- Testnet: https://api-testnet.nearblocks.io/api-docs/#/Kitwallet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Service Level\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Monitoring\\\\\\\\nWe will set up monitoring with notifications for visualizing API availability. System health and performance are available here: https://status.nearblocks.io. From our status monitor, we can send email and/or Slack notifications to major stakeholders. For reference, Nearblocks has been able to maintain a monthly uptime of 99.83%. We are aiming for 99.99% in the coming weeks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Response Time\\\\\\\\nAverage response time on the Nearblocks API is now sub-2 seconds. Legacy KitWallet endpoints are using LIKE queries, which are known to be less performant. We have avoided this due to additional indexing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent caveat: `likelyTokens` only supports tokens which Nearblocks supports. This includes all NEP-141 tokens and *most* [legacy tokens](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/tree/main/apps/indexer-events/src/services/contracts/ft). We are constantly working to add missing [legacy tokens](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=token_request.md&title=).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Rate Limiting\\\\\\\\nNearblocks API rate limiting is enforced by IP address and API keys. Given this is a public good endpoint, we will limit 150 queries per minute per IP address. We believe this should be within a very generous fair usage policy. This can be made flexible and is open for discussion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Support\\\\\\\\n- Support Availability: GitHub issues available here https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues \\\\\\\\n- Response Time: 24-48 hours through GitHub issues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Data Integrity\\\\\\\\nThe KitWallet endpoints are backed by existing Nearblocks data, which is indexed from Near Lake.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Updates and Changes\\\\\\\\nWe have no plans to make changes to KitWallet endpoints. We previously created these endpoints to support drop-in replacements without any work required other than replacing the endpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Usage\\\\\\\\nWe will track KitWallet usage through the Nearblocks API key dashboard for real-time usage. This can be made available to stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![API Usage Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceefc8e0-a74a-4299-8bdb-98258c0f7ca1)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Approach\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Move Nearblocks KitWallet endpoints to be accessible from the existing endpoint (i.e., https://api.kitwallet.app/) to allow for a seamless transition experience with no downtime for any existing users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. We are aware that there are remaining unknown users using this legacy endpoint. As we can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reach out to suggest a transition to alternative solutions, we will set up a landing page on kitwallet.app stating the current situation and directing them to alternative solutions as well as a point of contact that will be monitored. The landing page will explain the KitWallet transition plans with links to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Existing Documentation with user guide\\\\\\\\n- Support available through GitHub Issues\\\\\\\\n- Alternatives like Nearblocks API and FastNear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$4,000 / month for 12 months - to ensure excess capacity for additional traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Experience & Portfolio\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks.io is our flagship product; however, we have built other products in the past on NEAR, such as nearsend.io.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThank you for considering Nearblocks.io. We look forward to the possibility of working together to bring this transition to completion.
