(Find more details here: https://github.com/dwallet-labs/dwallet-network, https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/253.pdf)\\\\\\\\n* Permissionless onboarding of new chains, so ecosystems can onboard themselves in a self-service manner. Existing ecosystem integrations include Bitcoin, EVM, Cosmos, Sui, and Fuel.\\\\\\\\nOffers sophisticated transaction policies down to the payload level (e.g., allowing limits on swapping, lending, and borrowing amounts) and other features like user management, address book, and trustless recovery (with a Ledger).\\\\\\\\n* Access dApps through our dApp store ecosystem in a secure manner, safeguarded by our policy engine.\\\\\\\\nInstitutional-grade security, with part of the key secured by Pera\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized MPC network and the other part by our mobile signing app using the mobile phone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s secure enclave.\\\\\\\\n* Integration of chain abstraction and chain-abstracted DeFi services into our product.\\\\\\\\n* Product vision: Become a platform for AI agents that users can hire to execute tasks for them, such as executing sophisticated trading strategies (e.g., going long on revenue-generating DeFi projects, shorting infrastructure projects), and advising users on proper risk management techniques. Here we see synergies with NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s strategy and hence would want to integrate such projects and work closely together with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Benefits for the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR into a multi-chain custody solution with policy engine support (NEAR token holders can restrict sender, receiver, and amount of assets being transferred). This increases accessibility of NEAR assets for institutional and sophisticated investors (market makers, liquid/venture funds, sophisticated teams/individuals) to hold assets. The product will be gradually made open-source over the next years.\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR multi-chain DeFi projects to be used directly by sophisticated investors from within our product (e.g., swapping and lending).\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR AI agents into our platform to offer our customers services provided by these agents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NEAR integration (Target: Q4 2024)**\\\\\\\\n* Mainnet launch in Q4 2024, dependent on Pera network\\\\\\\\n* Integration of the NEAR RPC API into our chain integration SDK to communicate with and read transactions from the NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n* Completion of security audits for our core smart contracts and the NEAR transaction assembling module (written in Move)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**dApp integration (Q1 2025)**\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR ecosystems into our integrated dApp store (as described here: https://x.com/ilblackdragon/status/1821933128799211618)\\\\\\\\n* Incorporation of the NEAR wallet selector into our multi-chain extension framework\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\n**Milestone 1: NEAR integration**\\\\\\\\n* Users can hold assets on NEAR and execute transfers of the NEAR native asset, NEP-141 fungible token standard, and NEP-171 non-fungible token standard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Milestone 2: dApp integration**\\\\\\\\n* Users can natively use the top 10 NEAR dApps through our dApp interface.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Alternatives:\\\\\\\\n* On-chain multi-sigs (e.g., Gnosis Safe, Squads): Suffer from fragmentation across chains and lack support for non-smart contract chains. However, for NEAR, there is no native multi-sig available offering the same features as Aeon does.\\\\\\\\n* MPC-based institutional custody players (e.g., Fireblocks): Slow to innovate, permissioned, closed source, not built from the ground up for DeFi interactions, and expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Our Advantages:\\\\\\\\n* Built for DeFi & AI agents: Manage all your positions within our platform.\\\\\\\\n* Ability to hire AI agents constrained by the policy engine built for DeFi.\\\\\\\\n* Institutional-grade security: Truly decentralized and censorship-resistant. Transactions are cosigned by the user\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mobile phone enclave and a decentralized network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent testnet launch with 10 investors testing our product.

The team includes a senior front-end developer and a senior back-end developer. Their work includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [heroes.build application](https://heroes.build)\\\\\\\\n- NEARWEEK BOS widgets\\\\\\\\n- Various Github, Telegram & Twitter bots\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of Relevant Experience with NEAR Blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [Near-Staking.com](https://near-staking.com/)\\\\\\\\n- [SputnikDAO](https://nearweek.github.io/sputnik-dao-2-ui-reference-mainnet/#/genesis.sputnik-dao.near)\\\\\\\\n- Lockup contract and UI\\\\\\\\n- Multisig UI\\\\\\\\n- Various BOS components: \\\\\\\\n  - [NearStats](https://dev.near.org/denysk.near/widget/NearStats)\\\\\\\\n  - [PriceStats](https://near.social/denysk.near/widget/PriceStats)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Affiliations with Other NEAR Ecosystem Partners\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEARWEEK is the official newsletter of the NEAR ecosystem, collaborating with major NEAR stakeholders and cross-chain platforms like Messari, Coingecko, and CoinmarketCap.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe team has 10+ years of full-stack experience, including Java and C++, and 2 years of experience with Rust for the NEAR blockchain, alongside JavaScript and React for frontend development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-Technical Capabilities\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEARWEEK has a large team focused on marketing, social media, and design, but these will not be relevant to the near-staking project, which is primarily a development effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Motivation for the Proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the blockchain industry, especially on proof-of-stake blockchains, a thriving validator ecosystem is crucial for a transparent and tamper-proof decentralized ledger. Accurate real-time data on validator uptime and staking rewards is essential. Near-staking.com has provided this service for over 3 years, receiving valuable feedback from the ecosystem. This proposal aims to upgrade the near-staking infrastructure based on that feedback. We have adjusted our initial proposal based on the IC feedback, please find the thread [here](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/129)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Building Blocks of Near-Staking.com\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Near-Staking Rewards and Balances** - Review and confirm data reliability.\\\\\\\\n- **Validator Dashboard**\\\\\\\\n- **NEAR Private RPC Node**\\\\\\\\n- **NEAR Fastnear Indexer** - Significantly upgrade underlying server infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Technical Expertise\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Senior Rust Developer\\\\\\\\n- Mid/Senior Frontend Developers\\\\\\\\n- UI Designer\\\\\\\\n- Senior DevOps/Validator\\\\\\\\n- Database Engineer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll required resources are available in-house.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe proposal covers a 1-year period, including specific infrastructure upgrades and general maintenance. Key milestones include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Upgrade NEAR indexer server infrastructure** (1 month of backend/frontend work)\\\\\\\\n- **Analyze reliability of rewards & balances data** (2 months of QA work)\\\\\\\\n- **Push required updates** based on findings (up to 2 months of frontend & backend implementation)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Uptime of near-staking service:** Target 95% uptime.\\\\\\\\n- **Precision of staking rewards & balances data:** Aim for up to 0.5% accuracy, with potential for 0.1% inaccuracies in specific cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince [NEAR Validators](https://pages.near.org/about/network/validators/) has been discontinued, the following projects offer complementary services:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **[Nearblocks.io](https://nearblocks.io/):** A block explorer that provides different data, not specializing in accurate staking rewards & balances.\\\\\\\\n- **[Pikespeak.ai](https://pikespeak.ai/):** A data platform for the NEAR ecosystem with explorer capabilities and data dashboards but does not specialize in accurate staking rewards & balances.\\\\\\\\n- **[Nearscope.net](https://nearscope.net/):** Similar to near-staking, but lacks reliable transaction-based rewards data. Provides historical network performance graphs, which near-staking does not.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe request $5,000 USD equivalent per month over a 1-year period, totaling $60,000 USD equivalent.

(Find more details here: https://github.com/dwallet-labs/dwallet-network, https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/253.pdf)\\\\\\\\n* Permissionless onboarding of new chains, so ecosystems can onboard themselves in a self-service manner. Existing ecosystem integrations include Bitcoin, EVM, Cosmos, Sui, and Fuel.\\\\\\\\nOffers sophisticated transaction policies down to the payload level (e.g., allowing limits on swapping, lending, and borrowing amounts) and other features like user management, address book, and trustless recovery (with a Ledger).\\\\\\\\n* Access dApps through our dApp store ecosystem in a secure manner, safeguarded by our policy engine.\\\\\\\\nInstitutional-grade security, with part of the key secured by Pera\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decentralized MPC network and the other part by our mobile signing app using the mobile phone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s secure enclave.\\\\\\\\n* Integration of chain abstraction and chain-abstracted DeFi services into our product.\\\\\\\\n* Product vision: Become a platform for AI agents that users can hire to execute tasks for them, such as executing sophisticated trading strategies (e.g., going long on revenue-generating DeFi projects, shorting infrastructure projects), and advising users on proper risk management techniques. Here we see synergies with NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s strategy and hence would want to integrate such projects and work closely together with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Benefits for the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR into a multi-chain custody solution with policy engine support (NEAR token holders can restrict sender, receiver, and amount of assets being transferred). This increases accessibility of NEAR assets for institutional and sophisticated investors (market makers, liquid/venture funds, sophisticated teams/individuals) to hold assets. The product will be gradually made open-source over the next years.\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR multi-chain DeFi projects to be used directly by sophisticated investors from within our product (e.g., swapping and lending).\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR AI agents into our platform to offer our customers services provided by these agents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NEAR integration (Target: Q4 2024)**\\\\\\\\n* Mainnet launch in Q4 2024, dependent on Pera network\\\\\\\\n* Integration of the NEAR RPC API into our chain integration SDK to communicate with and read transactions from the NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n* Completion of security audits for our core smart contracts and the NEAR transaction assembling module (written in Move)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**dApp integration (Q1 2025)**\\\\\\\\n* Integration of NEAR ecosystems into our integrated dApp store (as described here: https://x.com/ilblackdragon/status/1821933128799211618)\\\\\\\\n* Incorporation of the NEAR wallet selector into our multi-chain extension framework\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n### Metrics\\\\\\\\n**Milestone 1: NEAR integration**\\\\\\\\n* Users can hold assets on NEAR and execute transfers of the NEAR native asset, NEP-141 fungible token standard, and NEP-171 non-fungible token standard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Milestone 2: dApp integration**\\\\\\\\n* Users can natively use the top 10 NEAR dApps through our dApp interface.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Alternatives:\\\\\\\\n* On-chain multi-sigs (e.g., Gnosis Safe, Squads): Suffer from fragmentation across chains and lack support for non-smart contract chains. However, for NEAR, there is no native multi-sig available offering the same features as Aeon does.\\\\\\\\n* MPC-based institutional custody players (e.g., Fireblocks): Slow to innovate, permissioned, closed source, not built from the ground up for DeFi interactions, and expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Our Advantages:\\\\\\\\n* Built for DeFi & AI agents: Manage all your positions within our platform.\\\\\\\\n* Ability to hire AI agents constrained by the policy engine built for DeFi.\\\\\\\\n* Institutional-grade security: Truly decentralized and censorship-resistant. Transactions are cosigned by the user\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mobile phone enclave and a decentralized network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent testnet launch with 10 investors testing our product.

An innovative solution by pushing data to users upon availability. This approach ensures faster, more reliable, and consistent data transmission, fostering trust in the accuracy and timeliness of the data you deliver. Unlike traditional data providers like RPCs or your own node and custom solutions.It efficiently retrieves and delivers transactional data to your preferred destination like S3, Webhook, Kafka etc., ensuring uninterrupted streaming, even during chain reorganizations while maintaining data consistency and with 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions enable to transform streamed data, boosting efficiency and reducing data size by retrieving exactly the data you need, when you need it.

Instead of depending on slow, unreliable subgraphs with a GraphQL interface making it useless when it comes to use at scale. Super Indexers is the solution to all the problems which subgraphs bring along with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Proposal:**\\\\\\\\nThis proposal aims to add support to NEAR blockchains and bring the leading innovative solution by being a bespoke blockchain data infrastructure platform to the NEAR ecosystem. Project Zero has a Data extraction and transformation (Block functions), streaming product that eliminates the burden of handling and managing chain reorgs, data inconsistency, unreliable RPCs which are impractical to use at scale, and extremely costly. Project Zero is stepping into the next phases to solve a-z blockchain data-related problems which includes products like Rich API endpoints, Query Engine and Super Indexers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the current scenario, even with the fractional existing solutions, none of them are supporting NEAR blockchain besides The Graph. The following are the benefits for the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\nHuge incentive for the builders to launch on NEAR with a significantly reduce time to market dApp due to a free plug-and-play data infrastructure\\\\\\\\nNone of the so-called incumbent solutions support NEAR (Alchemy, quicknode, goldsky etc.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the problems we are solving are very fundamental and relevant wherever on-chain data is required, NEAR developer ecosystem (dApps) can reap all the benefits by saving up to 2x time-to-market and saving their previous limited funding by eliminating the need to maintain huge infrastructure and specialized backend developers. As part of the proposal, we would like to provide 100GB/month of free usage of Streaming + Block Functions at no cost of NEAR blockchain data for 12 months from the date of approval of the proposal. Project Zero is a closed source solution with its proprietary technology and algorithms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Goals / Milestones:**\\\\\\\\nAdding Near blockchains dataset from genesis: Q3 2024  \\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data: Always ongoing\\\\\\\\nImplement and provide free usage (100GB/month) of Project Zero data streaming of NEAR blockchain (Launch as soon as Task 1 is finished)\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products on Near: \\\\\\\\nFirst set of Rich APIs (Ex: Token API, Transaction history API etc.): End of Q3 or Start Q4 2024\\\\\\\\nMore sets of Rich APIs (always ongoing): Q4 2024 and beyond for more\\\\\\\\nData Lake and Query Engine on NEAR Blockchain: Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexers v1.0 on NEAR: End of Q4\\\\\\\\\\\\'24 or Beginning Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\nSupport other types of off chain and chain data like Price feeds etc.: Q1\\\\\\\\u{2019}25\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe timelines are subjected to the proposal approval date. We are assuming the proposal gets approved well before the end of Q3\\\\\\\\u{2019}24. For the other new products (4-6), we will try to provide some Freemium usage for the NEAR community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Metrics:**\\\\\\\\nThe key success criteria or metrics are:\\\\\\\\nAdoption of Project Zero by NEAR dApps\\\\\\\\nUser retention\\\\\\\\nHigh NPS/CSAT score\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Competitor Comparison:**\\\\\\\\nWe don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t find any 1:1 competitor who is solving all the blockchain data infrastructure problems but we view competitors at specific products level.\\\\\\\\nStreaming & Transformation - Quicknode: Project Zero has an edge with the additional type of chain reorg handling strategy, performance of chain reorg handling, higher throughput and optimized block functions. On a fast blockchain like Arbitrum, Project Zero handles more than 4 blocks per second where the existing solution isn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even close to it!\\\\\\\\nSuper Indexer - The Graph (only major indexer supporting NEAR): Subgraphs on The Graph network lack usability at scale and are highly rate limited with GraphQL endpoints. Moreover the availability and freshness of real-time data isn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t common as the entire model is based on the network of operators which prefers maintaining high incentive subgraphs and blockchains. Project Zero will eliminate all these problems by providing a highly available stream of indexed data at a rapid throughput, negligible delay in real-time data update and 100% delivery guarantees.\\\\\\\\nQuery Engine and Rich APIs: There are no major platforms supporting NEAR but Project Zero differentiates with its modular architecture where adding new tables, blockchains, custom data and scaling new APIs is significantly low effort with high performance. Most of our filters by contract/address on optimized tables give subsecond performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Usage & Examples:**\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is the bespoke data infrastructure for Nexera Exchange, leveraging both historical backfills and real-time data of Ethereum and Arbitrum to their destination tools and platforms for several features. The most popular features are the [price chart](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100) and [order book](https://app.nexera.exchange/trade/ethereum/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7/100). Nexera built entire backend modules based on Project Zero data and created several services for volume, price, order status, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNexera Exchange faced several complications in extracting blockchain data at scale for something as simple as price charts on different time frames. They were dependent on several RPCs on very expensive pricing plans, which were also limited due to trace and debug calls. With Project Zero, they can stream historical data in minutes, resulting in immense performance gains, better user experience, and reduced costs. They mainly use \\\\\\\\u{2018}blocks with receipts\\\\\\\\u{2019} and \\\\\\\\u{2018}Logs\\\\\\\\u{2019} from different block numbers across multiple streams. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of Project Zero, Nexera Exchange benefits from faster chain reorg handling (4 blocks per second) on Arbitrum, which existing solutions can\\\\\\\\u{2019}t offer. We reduced recurring infrastructure costs of 15k/month to one-third of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject Zero is already empowering and soon empowering (in a few weeks from now) following blockchains Arbitrum, Bitlayer, Scroll, Manta, Polygon, Base, Optimism, Solana and Binance chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Total:**\\\\\\\\n$240,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Breakdown:**\\\\\\\\nThe budget will mainly be used for scaling and maintaining infrastructure and operation costs of the products\\\\\\\\nAdding NEAR blockchain dataset from genesis\\\\\\\\nMaintaining the real-time as well as historical data\\\\\\\\nOffer free streams of 100GB/month on NEAR\\\\\\\\nBlock Functions (edge computing) for data transformation & filtering\\\\\\\\nLaunch new features and products like Rich APIs, Query Engine and Super Indexers on NEAR from initial public versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are flexible in the recurring payment period of yearly, quarterly or monthly but with grants support for at least a year.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"projectzero.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"240000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\", \"Indexers\", \"Query API\", \"Data Lakes\"]}"

We use BlockPi as our Main RPC provider for our indexing since they provide reliable node infrastructure and RPC endpoints. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition to these affiliations our team members spoke to NEAR team members and projects in the ecosystem in the past. We learned  that the data infrastructure on NEAR was underserved. These initial contacts let us dive deeper into the NEAR blockchain ecosystem which is why we like to get involved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nA previous co-founder, Russell McLernon, was very active in NEAR around 2018-2019.

Data is often provided through APIs, which provide fiction and additional costs for projects. Other indexing tools require custom coding and hosting. Specific data models are frequently introduced, which allows for too many intermediate steps that add friction and costs. The current data providers come with their own opinions on how data should be processed, stored, and sold. All of this leads to web3 businesses being forced to further build data infrastructure in-house to get the end data their products actually need. When solving this problem, we can try to eliminate the API layers on top of centralized solutions, make the data infrastructure reliable, and ensure developers have enough control over retrieving the data. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe started The Indexing Company to directly address the actual problems web3 businesses face in accessing data. They need affordable, reliable data infrastructure that they control. That infrastructure is fully configurable by and therefore controlled by, end businesses. All of which translates to the elimination of much of the \\\\\\\\u{201c}standard\\\\\\\\u{201d} web3 data architecture. With us, a business gets exactly the data they need in their databases or in their dApps from the beginning. We aim to have no centralized database or data to sell directly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the challenges in the expansion of the NEAR ecosystem is to service the developers with good data tooling so they can work towards Chain Abstraction and the fast throughput of NEAR. NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s high throughput, with daily transaction amounts varying between 2 million to 6 million last year, generates a vast amount of data that requires efficient processing. Developers need a way to find exactly the data they require without having to process excess information. The challenge lies in:\\\\\\\\n- Maintaining the indexers and data infrastructure needed to get data from these chains.\\\\\\\\n- Having data pipelines that can handle the high throughput of NEAR. \\\\\\\\n- Getting data from other chains and data related to AVS like Validator data. \\\\\\\\n- Acquiring talented developers to manage this infrastructure, do the indexing and perform the data engineering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are planning to develop a solution called the Data Marketplace. Developers of dApps can come to the console of the marketplace to configure the data pipelines they want by selecting the data, do custom transformations and stream the data directly to their own data infrastructure. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers need a way to find exactly the data they require without having to process excess information. We believe the Data Marketplace is an excellent solution to this problem, as it streamlines data access and reduces the burden on developers, allowing them to focus on building innovative applications. In the long run we want to open up the Data Marketplace for other suppliers, for now we want to focus on solving the demand and making the data pipeline configuration as easy as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### The Data Marketplace\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Data Marketplace can be interacted with by developers through an easy to use interface. Since we believe the future is multi-chain and modular, the Data Marketplace will be fitting for the NEAR ecosystem and data needs of the builders. This means that the data offered in the interface can come from NEAR, while we also can offer other types of data like Farcaster data or other chains. For the Farcaster data we have an example workflow live: https://console.indexing.co/marketplace/66b3798bcc24e0cc3333b2d9\\\\\\\\nWe aim to support whole ecosystems like NEAR and can provide support with guidance from the ecosystem. The perspective from the NEAR ecosystem can help with defining presets and templates, while being opinionated on which data is most important for the builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe interface will give developers an easy way to configure which data they want:\\\\\\\\n1. Data selection: Developers can select the chain(s) they want data from. Since they might need specific data they could select wide data criteria like all ERC20/token transfers, logs, or DEX Swaps. If they only want specific data like contracts or events they will be able to select these specifically. This way of configuration ensures only processing happens for the data they want and reduces the amount of data storage on the developers end.\\\\\\\\n2. Backfilling historical data: After selecting the data we can use those parameters to get the historical data and backfill that data. Because of the cache we build up for a chain and optimized infrastructure the backfills can be done really fast.\\\\\\\\n3. Real time data streaming: For new data being indexed based on that data selection the pipelines can provide low-latency throughput to the target data infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n4. Custom transformations: To ensure the data fits the target data schemas and reduce further processing by the developers, custom transformations can be done in the data pipelines. This enables developers to build a more unified data schema and makes integrating new data and chains easier. \\\\\\\\n5. Support and feedback function: Developers might not be familiar with the interface or need help configuring the data pipelines. We aim to have personalized and custom support easily available to get the developers setup as fast as possible. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Why should the committee choose this project\\\\\\\\nWe believe that for Web3 to scale, the barrier to entry to build needs to be easier and more cost-effective. Currently, there is this rite of passage when it comes to getting clean, usable Web3 data: Accumulate third-party API providers, combine them with your own in-house custom logic, and you get a messy pipeline that begins to break down as you scale. Our solution eliminates all of that with fast, affordable, on-demand processing. We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re proving this out by saving companies like Once Upon, Bello and Mesh hundreds of thousands per year and months of development time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Data Marketplace will help NEAR developers have an easy way to get the data they need, delivered wherever they need since we not only have the indexing on demand, but the self-service interface will reduce the effort needed to configure the data pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n1. Onboard NEAR to our Indexing Pipelines and our internal Data Marketplace. Processing the data once, helps us develop the test environment and eventually use this historical data.\\\\\\\\n2. Identify 3-5 key NEAR ecosystem data needs such as NFT sales or DeFi swaps and build presets for those. The research of these data needs helps us define our presets, while ensuring NEAR developers can use these presets directly in their applications. \\\\\\\\n3. Create a self-serve interface for developers to easily configure the data pipelines. We would like to make the onboarding process as easy as possible and thus a graphical interface could streamline the process.\\\\\\\\n4. Create connectors to the target data infrastructure and create templates for data schemas. To ensure good connectivity between our pipelines and the target data infrastructure various most commonly used connectors should be programmed. Data schemas could be provided to help developers easily setup the structure in their own data infrastructure and make the setup process seamless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n#### Indexer and fast backfills\\\\\\\\nTo remove the need for developers to setup and maintain the data infrastructure for the indexer and data pipelines. Since NEAR is a high throughput chain, we will optimize the indexer for speed. Focusing on high throughput optimization will enable fast backfilling of historical data. For real time indexing we aim to reduce the time from block confirmation to hit the data infrastructure within max 5 seconds.. We will have the option for developers to delay blocks being processed with a cache, to ensure finality on the chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Data Marketplace Presets \\\\\\\\n3-5 key ecosystem data needs to be exposed as presets on the Data Marketplace. These presets come from the needs of the developers and dApps on NEAR. A few examples of what these presets can be:\\\\\\\\n- DeFi swaps and token pricing\\\\\\\\n- Token and NFT metadata on-chain\\\\\\\\n- Token transfers\\\\\\\\n- NFT transfers\\\\\\\\n- Wallet holdings \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Self-Service interface\\\\\\\\nThe self-service interface will remove the need from developers to create complex configuration files and learn a new framework. We will have the possibility to do transformations and custom calculations in both the interface and in code. We can\\\\\\\\u{2019}t give estimates on the time and frustration reduction on the developers end although we aim to have the following elements in the interface:\\\\\\\\n- Previewing the data\\\\\\\\n- Custom transformation in both the UI and in a code editor\\\\\\\\n- Selection of data output data infrastructure\\\\\\\\n- Possibility to backfill the data\\\\\\\\n- Support functionality\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Data infrastructure connectivity\\\\\\\\nWe aim to support the most common databases, starting with Postgres while we also would like to support writing to AWS S3. We also would like to support Webhooks. Further output targets and connectors could be determined together with the NEAR builders and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Data Marketplace itself is in development while pieces of the technology of the underlying data infrastructure and indexer are already active for more than 15 businesses using our technology. Users include: Mesh, Bello, Disco, Karma3Labs, Crystal, Absinthe Labs. With more new businesses and ecosystems in the pipeline. A solution called Just In Time Indexing received support and a grant from the Starknet ecosystem, which is currently being developed.   \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the more than 15 customers we have, we process more than 250M transformations per month, with in some months tapping into more than 500M transformations when more backfills are needed. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$85,000 for onboarding the data, the indexer, the Data Marketplace interface and the connectivity to the output infrastructure. An additional $50,000 could be budgeted for resources for the NEAR developer community.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### $10,000 for onboarding NEAR data\\\\\\\\nTo onboard the NEAR data we will have costs to process the historical data and keep up with the real time data. We call historical nodes to retrieve the data, decode all data and store them in compressed files. These files will be needed for efficiently backfilling the historical data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### $25,000 to build the NEAR Data Marketplace presets\\\\\\\\nFor building the Data Marketplace presets we will have to do market research and on-chain analytics to define which subsets of data will be the base for the presets. Presets might be obvious like NFT transfers or DeFi transactions, but we will have to include finding edge cases to make the data reliable. The developers need to build out these presets so they can easily be queried or requested. Finally, the testing and checks of the data is included in this estimation. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### $25,000 for the self-service user interface\\\\\\\\nTo ensure a smooth developer experience we will create a compelling self-service user interface to ensure easy onboarding and less custom development work. In addition we will create documentation and content for developers to easily understand the interface and functionalities. These materials will be used in marketing for the Data Marketplace for further visibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### $25,000 for the output data infrastructure connectivity\\\\\\\\nTo tailor to the wishes of the developers we would like to support as much popular target databases and infrastructure as possible. Ensuring the proper connectors are in place will help reduce the setup time and burden on the end-user. We would like to provide configuration files and data schemas for the developers to reduce the setups and data engineering they have to do in their own data infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### (Optionally) $50,000 to support builders with free data processing\\\\\\\\nSince we would like to support builders as fast as possible and without any hurdles, the NEAR Infrastructure grant committee could decide to cover costs upfront so builders can use the data marketplace for free during the first period. We can determine the amount of blocks or budget beforehand. Important is that during the processing we would only count the blocks being processed for a data pipeline, which means only blocks that fit the conditions will be counted. For example, if a data pipeline only processed DEX trades, if a block does not contain a DEX trade, this won\\\\\\\\u{2019}t be processed and thus won\\\\\\\\u{2019}t count for this budget. This removes unnecessary block processing which makes this very optimized for this budget. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have a different pricing for real time and backfilling data. The backfills can be more optimized and do not require real time monitoring, hence why these are cheaper. \\\\\\\\n- $0.80 / 1000 blocks for real time processing. On a $50,000 budget that would mean 62.5 million blocks can be processed.\\\\\\\\n- $0.20 / 1000 blocks for backfilling historical data. On a $50,000 budget that would mean 250 million blocks can be used during the backfilling process. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"7b060e2e85dbdfbd1ad55e735c4b28da904f7df9f9d409bb0c422923010ac99c\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"85000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Indexers\"]}"

He is a young Polish blockchain developer who graduated with a Master\\\\\\\\u{2019}s degree from the University of Science and Technology in Cracow. Before starting his own company, he worked as a trader at Star Beta and as a full-stack engineer at Rumblefish. Norbert has gained coding experience on several blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. He is one of the early contributors to the Anchor framework. His main focus is decentralized finance; his first major project, Synthetify, led him to win the 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon. He is also a contributor and advisor to several projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, we have won several hackathons, such as the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. As a team, we have been awarded multiple grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\nWe have been developing a wallet on NEAR since 2022 and received a grant that year. We have many partner projects, including Burrow Finance, Metapool, Everstake, and REF Finance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have established successful partnerships with other projects to provide our users with additional features. For example, we have implemented a swap feature thanks to our partnership with REF Finance and offer liquid staking through our cooperation with Metapool. Additionally, users can stake directly through the wallet and choose from a variety of validators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\nOur core team has been working in crypto since 2020, though we have individually contributed to various other projects as well. We launched Nightly in Q2 2022. Initially, it was a wallet supporting only NEAR and Solana, but it now operates on over 10 chains, including Sui and EVMs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreviously, our team was involved in two major projects: Synthetify, a decentralized synthetic assets exchange built on Solana, and Invariant, an AMM DEX operating on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero.\\\\\\\\nOur team focuses on bringing new users to crypto by lowering the entry point. We offer a range of solutions, such as the \\\\\\\\\\\\'dApps\\\\\\\\\\\\' tab, which showcases the most important projects on the chain; the ability to buy tokens directly in the wallet; and Nightly Connect, which facilitates the connection between dApps and wallets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have achieved victories in various hackathons, including the CTF MOVEment Hackathon and the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon. Our team has also secured several grants from the Aleph Zero Foundation, the Vara Foundation, and the NEAR Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nWe were among the first wallets on NEAR. We were the first to fully support NEAR Wallet migration and the first to implement cross-chain functionality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur wallet has pioneered advanced features such as liquid staking within the wallet, in-wallet swaps, and DApps integration. We successfully developed Nightly Connect v1 to simplify the connection between the wallet and dApps, implemented hardware wallet support, and integrated domain management directly within the wallet. Additionally, we have built a fully supported mobile wallet on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese achievements have advanced NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s capabilities and solidified our position as innovators in the ecosystem. However, we are continuously seeking new opportunities to develop features such as a Safari extension and the Earn tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\nWe are a fully independent team with our own Backend, Frontend, Design, and Marketing/BD teams. We are capable of building new features, developing smart contracts, and organizing activities such as AMAs and other community events both online and offline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\nEngineering Team: 9\\\\\\\\nDesign, UX/UI: 2\\\\\\\\nProject Management: 1\\\\\\\\nCustomer Support: 1\\\\\\\\nBD/Marketing: 2\\\\\\\\nTotal: 15 people\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Wallet - a multi-chain wallet designed to harness the full potential of blockchain. It includes both a browser extension and a mobile wallet, supporting Solana, NEAR, Aptos, Sui, Aleph Zero, Vara, Movement, Sonic, Polkadot and EVM.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect - a permissionless, open-source tool that functions as both a wallet adapter and a bridge wallet, enabling connections via QR codes or deep links. It simplifies the process for dApp developers by automatically adding all standard-compliant wallets after a one-time implementation. While minimal changes are needed on the wallet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s side for compatibility, these updates allow any mobile wallet to connect to any dApp through Nightly Connect, with additional features like push notifications. It is currently available on Solana, Sui, Aptos, and Movement, with plans to implement it on NEAR as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInvariant - a peer-to-peer system on Solana, Eclipse, and Aleph Zero for trading assets. It uses smart contracts to ensure security, self-custody, and resistance to censorship, all without relying on intermediaries who could limit access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (The primary approach and solution of the proposal.)\\\\\\\\nNightly and NEAR share similar approaches to the future of their products. NEAR projects are expanding and exploring cross-blockchain solutions in the Web3 space (https://near.org/blog/nuffle-labs). Nightly aligns with these values as the first multi-chain wallet supporting NEAR, and we continue to integrate additional chains to provide our users with a comprehensive experience, including easily accessible blockchains and their unique features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, we believe that successful products must continually evolve to make crypto usage as simple and accessible as possible. To this end, we have been diligently developing new features over the past few months. Notable additions include:\\\\\\\\n- Sidepanel: This feature allows our extension wallet to function as a constantly open side panel alongside the active extension.\\\\\\\\n- Mobile App: We are updating our mobile wallet to mirror the features of our extension wallet, ensuring it is equally functional and useful.\\\\\\\\n- Hardware Wallet Integrations: We are working on supporting various hardware wallets, including Keystone, and are also aiming to integrate Keystone support into our mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur primary goal is to enhance the functionality and utility of crypto wallets, making them essential tools for interacting with any dApp. At Nightly, we are committed to expanding the capabilities of wallets beyond their traditional roles. We have made significant progress in diversifying our income through various revenue streams, including partnerships with other dApps. These strategic collaborations will enable us to create sustainable and profitable solutions within the wallet ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n- Staking: We partner with validators such as Everstake to encourage users to stake through Nightly.\\\\\\\\n- Liquid Staking: Our partnership with Metapool allows users to liquid stake and receive stNEAR directly in their wallets without leaving the platform.\\\\\\\\n- Swaps: We have partnered with REF Finance and integrated their dApp into our wallet, allowing NEAR users to swap tokens directly within Nightly. We receive a fee from REF Finance for these transactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese features are already implemented in Nightly, but we aim to offer even more possibilities for an enhanced wallet experience, making Nightly the central hub for NEAR while ensuring our \\\\\\\\nsustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also developing additional features to help generate yield:\\\\\\\\nEarn Tab: This feature within our wallet allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens to on-chain dApps directly from the wallet. It includes options for borrowing, lending, creating pools, and liquid staking. Users will see APYs for each option, providing a comprehensive view in one place. This feature will also increase exposure for dApps on NEAR, enabling us to charge them a fee for the yield generated through this feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned before, we have been one of the first wallets on NEAR and the first multi-chain wallet. Additionally, we were the first wallet to support NEAR Wallet migration. Our dedication to NEAR is evident, and our goal is not only to maintain our wallet and develop new solutions for ourselves but also to advance NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe aim to develop the NEAR wallet standard. Our objective is to preserve all existing functionalities while transitioning to a wallet standard that supports multiple wallets, similar to how it works on Solana, Sui, or Ethereum (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963). We have already implemented a similar solution for Aptos (https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md). This transition will enhance security, speed, and ease of use. NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current infrastructure requires a robust wallet standard, and we are well-positioned to not only maintain but also enhance it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, Nightly Connect could improve analytics by analyzing traffic and providing more comprehensive data, such as connections with dApps, used wallets, or time spent on dApps.\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n- We currently have 8,000 WAU (Weekly Active Users) and aim for at least 30% of them to start managing their tokens primarily through Nightly. This means not only holding tokens within our wallet but also taking proactive steps like lending or liquid staking through our \\\\\\\\u{201c}Earn\\\\\\\\u{201d} tab.\\\\\\\\n- Add hardware support to the mobile wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop support for a Safari extension to make iOS usage even easier.\\\\\\\\n- Implement push notifications within the wallet.\\\\\\\\n- Develop QR code payments.\\\\\\\\n- Develop Nightly Connect on NEAR to assist with gathering data and tracking traffic for dApps and wallets, in line with NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s current development approach.\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that the NEAR wallet standard built by us will be accepted by all wallets on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n- Advance wallet development to achieve full sustainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Be sure to communicate what the finished effort looks like.)\\\\\\\\nOnce we successfully integrate all our planned activities and develop the new features, we aim to double our user base and ensure that at least 30% of our users engage with NEAR dApps directly via Nightly.\\\\\\\\nNightly Connect will be completed, open-sourced, and ready for integration by dApps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Should include a timeline with milestones, including what will be delivered for each milestone.)\\\\\\\\nQuarter 1: Develop the mentioned features (Earn tab, hardware wallet support, Safari extension) and conduct marketing activities to promote these features.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 2: Build the new wallet standard for NEAR and pursue business development to encourage all NEAR wallets to implement it. Continue development of existing features within the wallet.\\\\\\\\nQuarter 3: Develop Nightly Connect to track dApp and wallet traffic, prepare analytics for this solution, and focus on business development and marketing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nThe key success metrics we will track are:\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Total number of unique users using dApp features within the wallet\\\\\\\\n- Number of dApps that integrate Nightly Connect\\\\\\\\n- Number of wallets that implement the new wallet standard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (How will we measure success?)\\\\\\\\nWe can track these statistics directly within the wallet. Additionally, we can monitor metrics such as unique users, events conducted within the wallet, users\\\\\\\\u{2019} devices, and newly created wallets.\\\\\\\\nAfter each quarter, we will prepare a summary of our progress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n$50,000 quarterly, according to https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/134\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Breakdown of funds usage. How will you use these funds? Be specific.)\\\\\\\\nAccording to Regular Quarterly Wallet Support Policy #134, we plan to use these funds for operations, maintenance, and continued improvements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will invest in developing the new features mentioned earlier, promote them with our partner dApps, and allocate funds for marketing activities to attract new users to NEAR.\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, we will use these funds for the development of Nightly Connect to provide dApps with data analytics tools and to build the Wallet Standard to enhance NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"3ca104db88eca30ab9a91c47148efe81e855d6793cabf3dec702e9796adba9e4\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"50000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\"]}"

Our company facilitated the first ever technical workshop about NEAR for software engineers in Serbia. During the ETH Belgrade and Belgrade Blockchain Week 2023, our company provided a venue for \\\\\\\\u{201c}NEAR Day\\\\\\\\u{201d} and \\\\\\\\u{201c}BOS Workshop\\\\\\\\u{201d} held by NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s experts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK has not deployed a production-level project on NEAR blockchain; however, 7 engineers from our company have passed the training in BOS and have experience in building BOS components. Team proposed for this project is very familiar with NEAR architecture and latest technical documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK has consistently strived to connect and bring together the Web3 community in the SEE region and participate in various programs to empower teams and individuals, thus cultivating our own talent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Web3 Supercluster**  \\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK is the founding member of Web3 Supercluster, a part of the \\\\\\\\u{201c}Serbia Innovates\\\\\\\\u{201d} program supported by USAID that seeks to strengthen the Serbian economy through R\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&D collaboration, education and skills development in the deep tech domain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Web 2.5 Academy**  \\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK holds a Web 2.5 Academy, aimed at enabling the inclusion of a wide range of participants with basic programming skills and directing them towards Web3 technologies, providing intrinsic knowledge in blockchain architecture, consensus mechanism, smart contracts and tooling. For the past 2 years, we have held 3 cohorts and trained more than 400 participants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Moonwalk**  \\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK has a four-month internship program Moonwalk, which is designed to bring out the best from a small group of selected candidates from our yearly educational programs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Glue**  \\\\\\\\nGlue, our Web3 acceleration program, is the premier launchpad for emerging teams and projects, emphasizing technology excellence and hands-on learning process under guidance of our mentors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Guesthouse**  \\\\\\\\nGuesthouse by MOONSTRUCK is held every year during Belgrade Blockchain Week. It represents a series of side events that cover relevant topics in the Web3 and Blockchain industry. For the past 2 years, we hosted 25 impactful events, engaging over 300 participants in workshops, discussions, presentations, training, etc. With the support from NEAR, Chainlink, ICP, Sui, Superchain and many other valued partners, we brought the Guesthouse event to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Swarm** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Decentralised Storage Service by Ethereum Foundation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Giveth** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Cryptocurrency donation platform and DeFi protocol that rewards donors of verified public goods projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bitcoin.com** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Automated Market Maker (AMM).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Hundrx** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Web3 extension for Twitter (X) enabling tokenization of profiles and enhanced interaction between influencers and followers via social tokens.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**AgAu** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- RWA digital platform for tokenization of investment gold and precious metals with fully collateralized cryptocurrency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**DeFire** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- DEX aggregation platform for transaction optimization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Tycoon** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Social crypto trading platform and cryptocurrency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Renfter** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Uncollateralized NFT Renting Protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Libertas** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Infrastructure and Protocol for TSF proof-of-work blockchain (L1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Disberse** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Transparency on-chain platform for tracking means of public funding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Asphodel** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Metaverse on-chain game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kamigotchi World** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- DAO governed on-chain game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Mirage Protocol** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Universal multichain asset-mirroring protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**TRAKEN** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Renewable energy aggregation and trading platform for smart electrical grids based on blockchain technology, enabling power purchasing agreements execution in the form of smart contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe propose to inherit the current implementation of the NEAR \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- IBC protocol, previously built by [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/) and prepare it for mainnet production as a version 1.0 release candidate. Furthermore, we would like to offer our services, collaborate with the relevant stakeholders in the Cosmos ecosystem and work towards developing further production releases with new features built in tight cooperation. Finally, we would like to commit a team towards long term maintenance and support of the project \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- including documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- IBC protocol is the NEAR implementation of the IBC protocol transport layer (IBC/TAO). The project integrates the implementation of the IBC protocol based Inter-Blockchain Communication fungible token transfer application (ICS20) to link the NEAR and Cosmos ecosystems, bringing greater composability to the innovation of the entire interchain blockchain Internet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMore information on the original project iteration is available on the accompanying [Octopus network Medium post.](https://medium.com/omnity/introduction-to-near-ibc-how-to-implement-the-ibc-protocol-with-smart-contracts-a8b0e13cb886)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur team has performed an extensive gap analysis and research of the current implementation version and has compiled a [gap analysis report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icI44qEgX3srzjx5EJQJs6LJRYy1-H96t4zzwh99\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_28/edit?usp=sharing) with our findings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe intend to release the codebase under a permissive open source license. We intend to discuss with the NEAR foundation and any other relevant stakeholders on the exact choice of the license we will be selecting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are currently at least two teams looking to utilize NEAR IBC as a solution. Our goal is to help these initial early adopters to achieve success and build a strong foundation for supporting other teams in the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Project Goals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe define two major goals for this proposal: **release** and **maintenance**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur **primary release goal** is to prepare a mainnet ready **NEAR IBC v1.0 release candidate** and deploy it into production on time and at quality. The release candidate should \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- implement all of the features of the NEAR IBC protocol spec   \\\\\\\\n- successfully pass a security audit by a reputable team (or platform).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur **secondary release goal(s)** are to support teams looking to integrate NEAR IBC into their products and protocols by well produced and detailed developer documentation as well as a working prototype (proof of concept) console based application as a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur **maintenance goal** is to commit a team to maintain the NEAR IBC project after the release candidate: fix bugs and security issues, prepare new releases, update and maintain documentation and provide first or second line support to teams that are using the protocol as a part of their solutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond our immediate goals, we wish to extend the current implementation towards a V2 release with the support of teams in the Cosmos ecosystem. With that in mind, we will ensure that the implementation stays clear and extensible towards future features and upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo that end we propose the project be divided into two phases: active development and maintenance cycle.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe propose the following milestones:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Alpha release: constitutes a version with a working happy path that can be tested in a local environment  \\\\\\\\n- V1 release candidate: constitutes a version with a demonstration PoC that is deployed to a testnet environment and is ready for an audit\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese milestones are based on our current understanding of the project and objectives and priorities. We invite the infrastructure team and the NEAR Foundation to help us define clearer milestones for delivery based on ecosystem priorities and shared understanding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Reporting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the **release phase** of the project, we suggest regular **2 week** intervals for reporting on the project status, coinciding with the **end of each working sprint**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs part of the report, the team would present (in agreed upon forum and format) the progress of the project, including any demonstration of functionality that can be performed. The project management team will also open a retrospective of the sprint, with the ability to discuss delivery velocity, risks or potential changes of scope.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the **support/maintenance** phase of the project, we suggest **monthly status updates** of work done: security and bug fixes, tech debt resolved, issues reported by the community etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe invite the Infrastructure Board and the NEAR Foundation to help us propose a clear and detailed way of reporting for the project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Engineering Estimation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the above gap analysis conclusions, we are able to suggest a provisional delivery scope and provide an expert estimation on engagement with development roles required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Provisional Scope\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe recommend the following scope of work in order to complete the project into a working solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Required\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Identify any and all components that need to be replaced from the project  \\\\\\\\n2. Determine development/integration/mitigation for the project  \\\\\\\\n3. Bring the project into a working state  \\\\\\\\n4. Implement a minimal testing framework with essential coverage  \\\\\\\\n5. Document a testing procedure for the project and perform smoke testing  \\\\\\\\n6. Upgrade the deployment procedure  \\\\\\\\n7. Provide documentation to changes  \\\\\\\\n8. Deploy solution to testnet  \\\\\\\\n9. Scope and implement a minimal PoC (terminal based)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Implement a full CI/CD release pipeline  \\\\\\\\n2. Implement deployment automation  \\\\\\\\n3. Implement full test coverage  \\\\\\\\n4. Add static analysis in manual or automated form  \\\\\\\\n5. Prepare separate detailed development documentation (for V1)  \\\\\\\\n6. Prepare examples for use  \\\\\\\\n7. Scope and implement a full PoC Dapp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Definition of Done\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe consider the solution as ready for release when it is deployed on a public/available testnet, with released code and artifacts in a state that is ready for audit or early integration. This functionally equates to a testnet release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis release constitutes a fully delivered project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe release includes a **working PoC** with demonstrable functionality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe release does not depend upon audits and integrations with third parties.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMOONSTRUCK will be fully committed to assist with any work required to fix any security issues discovered as well as integration to other projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Level of Effort and Timeline \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Development Phase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the provisional scope of the project and the expert estimation we are able to provide a provisional engagement for the project with required roles and effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project would be handled by a single Agile pod team with the project being their sole focus during the active development phase. Beyond that, experts will be made available to the pod based on task and project requirements. These team members constitute core and support roles:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Core Roles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Role | Responsibilities | Effort |\\\\\\\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\\\\\\\n| Project Lead, Blockchain Architect | Leadership, reporting, development | Part Time |\\\\\\\\n| Blockchain Engineer | Development, testing | Full Time |\\\\\\\\n| Blockchain Engineer | Development, testing | Full Time |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Support Roles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Role | Responsibilities | Effort |\\\\\\\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\\\\\\\n| Engineer in Test | Test automation | Part Time |\\\\\\\\n| Technical Writer | Documentation | Part Time |\\\\\\\\n| Devops | CI/CD, project deployment | Part Time |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Timeline\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe suggest the following timeline for the project, measured in **two week sprints**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Sprints | Description | Goals |\\\\\\\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\\\\\\\n| 1 | Finish gap analysis, perform spikes and fill backlog | Initial task backlog |\\\\\\\\n| 2, 3 | Perform smoke testing, write test scenarios, write automated tests, set up initial CI/CD, tech debt analysis | Alpha w/ demonstration capability, basic CI/CD pipeline |\\\\\\\\n| 4, 5 | Improved test coverage, tech debt resolution tasks, initial documentation, PoC candidate planning | Basic prototype w/ demonstration capability, documentation, PoC plan |\\\\\\\\n| 6 | PoC development, deployment to testnet, developer documentation, examples | Release Candidate: deployed to testnet w/ working PoC |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal estimate for delivery of the **proposed scope for V1** amounts to **three months** of effort for the engaged team.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Release schedule\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Release | End of sprint | Goal |\\\\\\\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\\\\\\\n| Alpha | 3 | Local release with a demonstrable happy path available |\\\\\\\\n| RC1 | 6 | Fully featured V1 release deployed to testnet with a working PoC |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Level of Effort and Timeline \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Support Phase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the release, we would assign a maintenance team to support the V1 release, ensuring it is working to spec and assisting other development teams with integration. Maintenance will also cover a certain amount of tech debt resolution from the development phase.

However, if the Infrastructure Committee decides to continue MNW\\\\\\\\u{2019}s maintenance rather than sunsetting it, we remain open to adapting our approach accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Background\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Initial Contract Duration**: The Meteor team received a 12-month maintenance contract, which has already extended beyond the agreed period, from March 2023 to the current date.\\\\\\\\n- [**Work Done to Date**](https://www.notion.so/4851f45e2b1c496ab426146d144d49d5?pvs=21): Here is a monthly breakdown of the completed work.\\\\\\\\n- **Provisional Approval**: The Infrastructure Committee has provisionally approved this proposal, with additional stipulations incorporated into this document. These discussions and comments can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/133).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Objectives:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Feature Reduction**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    Focus solely on critical maintenance and support for new NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs). We will halt adding new features and instead ensure the wallet remains functional with NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s evolving ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n2. **Transition Users to Other Wallets**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    Over time, we will assist MNW users in moving to alternative wallets. This process will be gradual to avoid any disruptions. We will also make sure that features like NEAR lockups are supported so that MNW doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t create barriers for users switching wallets.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n3. **RPC Call Optimization**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    RPC calls are an area for potential cost savings and performance improvement. While we cannot guarantee comprehensive changes immediately, we commit to reviewing current RPC usage and exploring optimizations wherever possible. This may include improving the efficiency of these calls or switching to indexers where applicable. \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n4. **Security Commitment**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    Throughout this period, we will respond to any security issues raised by the NEAR Foundation or Pagoda within 24 hours, ensuring MNW remains secure and user funds are protected until the final sunset.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n5. **Phased Sunsetting Approach**\\\\\\\\n    - **Year 1:** Begin gradually scaling back non-essential features and assisting users with transitioning their funds to other wallets. We will focus on essential maintenance to keep MNW functional, but new feature updates will be limited.\\\\\\\\n    - **Year 2:** Further reduce functionality while encouraging users to migrate to other wallets. The transition will be carefully managed to ensure minimal disruption.\\\\\\\\n    - **Final Phase:** A complete transition away from MNW, with full deprecation of the wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Financial Proposal:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Reduction:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecrease the annual budget from $180,000 to $150,000 for the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Contract Duration:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSeptember 2024 to September 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Payment Structure:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$37,500 per quarter, paid upfront before each quarter, covering:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Meteor team oversight (technical resources provided as needed)\\\\\\\\n- Support ticketing (e.g., Gleap support ticketing)\\\\\\\\n- Operational costs for server and software\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis budget accounts for essential operational expenses, including server fees and software costs required for MNW operations. Any additional costs, such as RPC services or other critical maintenance needs, will require further discussion and potential supplementary support to ensure MNW continues to function optimally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **First Quarter Payment Request:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo initiate the execution of this sunsetting plan, we kindly request the release of the first-quarter payment of $37,500.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Conclusion:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe remain committed to supporting MNW and the NEAR ecosystem. While we propose a gradual sunsetting of MNW, we are flexible and ready to continue maintaining it if the Infrastructure Committee opts to extend its life. Your support and guidance in this transition are appreciated, and we look forward to working together to ensure the best outcome for the NEAR community.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"web3hedge.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"37500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\"]}"

We will halt adding new features and instead ensure the wallet remains functional with NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s evolving ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n2. **Transition Users to Other Wallets**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    Over time, we will assist MNW users in moving to alternative wallets. This process will be gradual to avoid any disruptions. We will also make sure that features like NEAR lockups are supported so that MNW doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t create barriers for users switching wallets.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n3. **RPC Call Optimization**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    RPC calls are an area for potential cost savings and performance improvement. While we cannot guarantee comprehensive changes immediately, we commit to reviewing current RPC usage and exploring optimizations wherever possible. This may include improving the efficiency of these calls or switching to indexers where applicable. \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n4. **Security Commitment**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    Throughout this period, we will respond to any security issues raised by the NEAR Foundation or Pagoda within 24 hours, ensuring MNW remains secure and user funds are protected until the final sunset.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n5. **Phased Sunsetting Approach**\\\\\\\\n    - **Year 1:** Begin gradually scaling back non-essential features and assisting users with transitioning their funds to other wallets. We will focus on essential maintenance to keep MNW functional, but new feature updates will be limited.\\\\\\\\n    - **Year 2:** Further reduce functionality while encouraging users to migrate to other wallets. The transition will be carefully managed to ensure minimal disruption.\\\\\\\\n    - **Final Phase:** A complete transition away from MNW, with full deprecation of the wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Financial Proposal:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget Reduction:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecrease the annual budget from $180,000 to $150,000 for the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Contract Duration:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSeptember 2024 to September 2026.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Payment Structure:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$37,500 per quarter, paid upfront before each quarter, covering:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Meteor team oversight (technical resources provided as needed)\\\\\\\\n- Support ticketing (e.g., Gleap support ticketing)\\\\\\\\n- Operational costs for server and software\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis budget accounts for essential operational expenses, including server fees and software costs required for MNW operations. Any additional costs, such as RPC services or other critical maintenance needs, will require further discussion and potential supplementary support to ensure MNW continues to function optimally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **First Quarter Payment Request:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo initiate the execution of this sunsetting plan, we kindly request the release of the first-quarter payment of $37,500.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Conclusion:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe remain committed to supporting MNW and the NEAR ecosystem. While we propose a gradual sunsetting of MNW, we are flexible and ready to continue maintaining it if the Infrastructure Committee opts to extend its life. Your support and guidance in this transition are appreciated, and we look forward to working together to ensure the best outcome for the NEAR community.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"web3hedge.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"37500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"web3hedge.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
