We will ensure a smooth migration of NEAR Lake\\\\\\\\\\\\'s S3 storage, maintaining zero downtime for key stakeholders in the ecosystem. Our decentralized approach will prepare NEAR Lake for upcoming challenges like dynamic sharding, while supporting the current NEAR Lake libraries. With a proven track record of reliability, Lava is ready to handle the increasing complexity and growing demands of NEAR Lake\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure, as well as improve its access as a public good by exposing it to developers to query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNear lake\\\\\\\\u{2019}s integration will allow the enhancement of APIs on near, seamless replacement of vendors, and competition over performance and price, with the goal of replacing the need for RPFs in the future and allowing vendors to compete based on queries and costs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**This approach allows near to transition from a single provider, and a risk factor that needs to be addressed regularly by the infrastructure committee into an automatic technically solved solution that can scale and allow competitiveness.** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVendors will be encouraged to improve their costs and will allow the flexibility of any solution to be integrated in the future. We aim for the transition to be gradual, focusing on stability and making steps towards the goal of decentralizing and monetising the solution based on usage, while still offering the base rates as a public good.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Technical Requirements and Solution Proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **S3 Bucket Maintenance:** We will create and maintain two AWS S3 buckets: one for testnet and one for mainnet, both in the **eu-central-1 region**. The S3 storage will be handled using **S3 Standard** for 4.2 TB per month, with an average object size of 1.8 MB. Operations will include **300M PUT, COPY, POST, LIST requests** and **1 billion GET and SELECT requests** monthly paid by the requester. Strategies to optimize costs will be focused on **querying efficiency and minimizing storage overhead** by archiving older data when appropriate.\\\\\\\\n- **Lake Indexer Nodes:** Our proposal includes maintaining **two RPC nodes per network** (testnet and mainnet) with the **indexer framework enabled**. The indexer nodes will populate the S3 buckets with a low-latency, accurate data stream. We will utilize **t4g.xlarge instances** (over aws for latency and optimal block time, as detailed in the table). Exposing Near Lake to dapps through lava endpoints, allowing seamless development of indexing solutions using athena, for seamless integration of new indexing solutions, at controlled rates.\\\\\\\\n- **Adding a Near Lake incentive pool on Lava Network:** to encourage providers to create more efficient solutions, adding verifications of the quality of the content, and creating a multi vendor setup for Near Lake\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Cost Reduction Strategies\\\\\\\\nEnable a multi provider set up for Near Lake encouraging competition over price and quality, where rewards are given based on performance and usage of clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDetach Near Lake from the node and allow it to work with RPC, utilizing existing infra solutions rather than needing to track the chain with other instances. Utilizing RPC caching, multiple vendors can host the buckets, without running their own Near indexers. Separating Near Lake indexers from the storage allows a modular approach where each part of the stack can be improved. This opens up the stack for exploration for cheaper alternatives such as a decentralized storage, dedicated bare metals etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Monitoring and Alerts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo ensure smooth operations and proactive monitoring, we will use:\\\\\\\\n- **Grafana Metrics:** Visualizing up to 4k time series for up to 10 users.\\\\\\\\n- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for potential last block issues or storage overruns.\\\\\\\\n- **Logging:** Using Axiom for a 1 TB/month log retention plan with 95-day retention.\\\\\\\\n- **Status Page**: A public Statuspage to provide transparency on uptime, performance, and usage metrics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Scalable and Efficient Data Querying:\\\\\\\\nBuilding on our experience with LAVA\\\\\\\\\\\\'s RPC services, we will enhance NEAR Lake\\\\\\\\u{2019}s data query capabilities by implementing scalable and efficient querying mechanisms. Using Athena as an initial query engine, we will help developers integrate with Near Lake and experiment with the information it offers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we will leverage smart caching strategies to optimize frequently queried data, reducing unnecessary repetitive scans. As NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s ecosystem expands, our infrastructure can scale dynamically to handle increased data loads and traffic without compromising performance. By integrating ReadRPC solutions, we will ensure that both real-time and historical data are efficiently queried, offering developers and users quick and accurate responses, even as the complexity of NEAR Lake evolves with dynamic sharding and other protocol upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to provide a robust querying infrastructure that balances performance with cost efficiency, ensuring NEAR Lake remains a reliable data source as the ecosystem scales, while also helping indexers leverage its offering to build.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreement (SLA)\\\\\\\\nOur proposed NEAR Lake management solution will meet all RFP requirements with the following metrics:\\\\\\\\n- Uptime: 99.99%, ensuring continuous availability and zero downtime during the transition.\\\\\\\\n- Latency: Low latency for data queries and indexing, optimized through AWS services and auto-scaling infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### To enhance the SLA further, we will:\\\\\\\\n- Extensive monitoring\\\\\\\\n- Dedicated support channels\\\\\\\\n- Commission extra indexer nodes as a backup to catch up when there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lag due to a failure\\\\\\\\nEnsure multi-region failover for uninterrupted service.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Support\\\\\\\\nWe will provide both public and private channels for NEAR Lake support, ensuring quick resolutions to any issues. Dedicated communication lines will be set up for NEAR <> Lava users, with a goal to respond to issues within 4 hours and fully resolve them within 24-48 hours.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Our comprehensive support includes:\\\\\\\\n- 24/7 monitoring with proactive issue detection.\\\\\\\\n- Clear, transparent communication via a public status page to track performance, latency, and any ongoing incidents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Proposed Timeline and Milestones:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Total Budget: $660,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Transition and Setup:** $100,000\\\\\\\\n- Transfer and testing of NEAR Lake infrastructure\\\\\\\\n- Migration and setup of S3 buckets\\\\\\\\n- Indexer infrastructure setup and documentation\\\\\\\\n- Exposing near lake as an endpoint on lava\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Infrastructure**:\\\\\\\\n- **$16,000/month** for the first 6 months ($16,000 * 6 = $96,000)\\\\\\\\n- **$17,500/month** for the following 6 months ($17,500 * 6 = $105,000)\\\\\\\\n- Includes S3 bucket storage, indexer nodes, networking, athena and operational costs, monitoring (see table for break down)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support:** $5,000/month\\\\\\\\n- User and provider support\\\\\\\\n- Monitoring (Grafana, logging, alerts)\\\\\\\\n- Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Development:** $25,000/month\\\\\\\\nNear lake repository - further development and integration with advancement in sharding\\\\\\\\nAllowing Near Lake to work with RPC, separating the stack allowing the indexers to run on cheaper solutions\\\\\\\\nIntegration with different storage solutions without damaging the performance and latency\\\\\\\\nIntegration with lava exposing the data with athena as a public good endpoint\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **The majority of the budget doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t go to Lava, it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s distributed to top providers and NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s community.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Milestones\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 1 (Month 1):** Agreement signing and initial setup.\\\\\\\\n**Milestone 2 (Month 2):** Begin migration of NEAR Lake infrastructure, including S3 and indexers.\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 3 (Month 4):** Full operation with ownership on the current solution.\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 4 (Month 5):** athena endpoint exposed on lava.\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 5 (Month 7):** focus on infra cost reductions - separation of indexing from state tracking, exploration of cheaper storage alternatives\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 6 (Month 9):** setting up a second vendor based on the new tech stack, verifications in place for data integrity vs the previous solution\\\\\\\\n- **Milestone 7 (Month 10):** enabling incentives over lava based on usage for the multi vendor set up\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifh3n4b7dnhutedfahwnhddckvwycnbdqhchvxcc3ai5cb7x5rjce](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifh3n4b7dnhutedfahwnhddckvwycnbdqhchvxcc3ai5cb7x5rjce)\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"8d51039cd656f1d9716894420b62555b68022797e7214adf4f630c77caf1cf66\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"660000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"labels\": []}"
