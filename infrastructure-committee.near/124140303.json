He has been in the blockchain industry for 3+ years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNikita Grechino (Co-Founder) is a full-stack engineer with more than 6 years of experience. He has been working in the blockchain space since early 2022, focusing on the development of the front-end interface for crypto trading platforms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeorge Vosorov is an Integration Engineer at Chainspect, specializing in ETL and data warehouse development. He previously worked as a Data Engineer at Unilever, focusing on data pipelines.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\nNo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\nSee Team background and bios section\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\nYes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign, UX/UI: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProject management: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer support: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBD / Marketing: Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (The primary approach and solution of the proposal.)\\\\\\\\nChainspect (https://chainspect.app/) stands as a dedicated blockchain analytics platform, emphasizing technical metrics. As the leading TPS Tracker on the market, we aim to evolve into the foremost platform for fundamental blockchain analysis. Currently, we serve over 10,000 crypto investors and dApp developers monthly and cover 40+ of the most widely used blockchains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of it as CoinMarketCap, but instead focused on fundamental analysis and not price talks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nChainspect is the biggest TPS Tracker on the market, used by thousands of crypto investors and dApp developers monthly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur team has extensive experience with diverse chains, including EVM/Substrate ones. Chainspect manages the integration entirely, requiring only a reliable endpoint to connect to your network and information on system/voting transactions. This approach ensures the inclusion of valid transactions, fostering fair comparisons between blockchains. For instance, in the case of Solana, we exclude \\\\\\\\u{201c}voting\\\\\\\\u{201d} transactions tied to their custom consensus mechanism. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have already collaborated with chains such as BNB Chain, Fantom, Starknet, Sei, Stellar, Aptos, Hedera, Telos, and many others.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?)\\\\\\\\nNo, all code is private, but we do plan to release a public API to fetch our data in the future\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nThis proposal covers the integration of the NEAR blockchain into the Chainspect analytics platform, along with ongoing support and development to maintain NEAR as a listed chain for one year.\\\\\\\\nThe Chainspect team will handle the entire integration process, needing only a reliable endpoint to connect to your network and information on the system and voting transactions.\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR metrics displayed on the dashboard will include:\\\\\\\\n1. Realtime TPS (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)\\\\\\\\n2. Max Recorded TPS\\\\\\\\n3. Max Theoretical TPS\\\\\\\\n4. Time To Finality\\\\\\\\n5. Block Time\\\\\\\\n6. Governance Type\\\\\\\\n7. Launch Date\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe completed integration will include NEAR as part of Chainspect with all seven metrics described earlier. NEAR will receive continuous updates as Chainspect adds new metrics or UI improvements.\\\\\\\\nThe NEAR team will have the option to provide feedback on NEAR-related metrics and descriptions, which the Chainspect team will consider.\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, upon successful integration, Chainspect and NEAR can make a joint announcement on X/Discord and other platforms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, there are no other TPS trackers on the market that monitor 40+ blockchain networks 24/7 while standardizing metrics across different architectures and consensus mechanisms. Our closest competitors are blockchain media sources that occasionally publish blog posts on TPS and compare various networks. However, we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve observed that many of these media sources have started to use Chainspect as their primary data source, positioning Chainspect as the industry standard for TPS calculations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe annual fee for this proposal is $5800, preferably paid in USDT or USDC. This proposal includes only one milestone.\\\\\\\\nThe budget will cover development costs for the integration, research efforts to accurately calculate static metrics based on NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s architecture and technology, and ongoing hardware and labor costs to keep NEAR listed on Chainspect.\\\\\\\\nThis fee also ensures NEAR will continuously receive the latest metrics integrated into Chainspect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnnual fee of $5800 (preferably paid in USDT/USDC).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport and Development costs - $4000\\\\\\\\nOngoing technical support, software updates, and new feature development to ensure optimal performance and continuous improvement of NEAR metrics on the Chainspect platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware and infra costs - $1800\\\\\\\\nMaintenance of existing hardware/software and other infrastructure-related costs, related to keeping NEAR as one of the listed chains on Chainspect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"stillemail8340.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"5800\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Indexers\", \"Other\"]}"

This project aims to provide high-level blockchain statistics, detailed block and transaction pages, wallet and contract details, and track top tokens, token transfers, NFTs, and NFT transfers. Additionally, the explorer will include a tokens page, transaction execution plan, gas fee tracker, and display contract source code and methods, all while supporting the NEAR Chain Signature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe estimated timeline for project completion is structured into four phases. Phase 1 involves a two-week research period focused on the NEAR chain and its Chain Signature. During this phase, we will explore NEAR nodes and their RPC endpoints, understand smart contract functionality within NEAR, learn about multichain smart contracts, and determine how data should be organized and displayed to end users. Phase 2, spanning three weeks, will focus on designing the NEAR explorer. This includes how data should be stored, transformed, and indexed, as well as how token transfers and balances should be managed and served. We will also design the user interface for NEAR-specific pages, including execution plans, smart contracts, and tokens. Phase 3, which will take four weeks, involves implementation. This phase will include pulling all historical data from NEAR, running ETL processes to index the data, implementing NEAR-specific UI components, and integrating Chain Signature support. Finally, Phase 4, lasting two weeks, will involve deploying the explorer to production, performing thorough testing, and monitoring the system post-launch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor reference, you can review key features in the following live explorers: zkevm.socialscan.io, linea.socialscan.io, and mantle.socialscan.io. We also welcome any additional feature requests you may have for the explorer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fee structure for the services provided is as follows: The implementation and setup will cost $200,000, payable upon signing. This cost estimate covers approximately 2.5 months of work, during which three full-time engineers, one product manager, and one designer will be dedicated to the project. Additionally, there will be an annual service fee of $200,000 for handling up to 2 billion total transactions. This fee includes ongoing support for the blockchain explorers as outlined in the scope above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal aims to ensure that NEAR receives a robust and user-friendly blockchain explorer, equipped with all necessary features and designed for optimal performance and ease of use.

We want to build a tool for the entire community that will facilitate on-chain data and high-end analytics in an easy-to-read and to-understand format fit for both newbies and crypto-savvy individuals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nWe support the dedicated and shared RPC node infrastructure for NEAR so that all the ecosystem developers and projects can quickly access the NEAR network without setting up their own infrastructure.\\\\\\\\nGetBlock has been providing RPCs for NEAR since Q1 2022 and has achieved and provides service reliability of 99.9% for Q2 2024. The duplicate NEAR nodes setup and the automatic failover system ensure the stability of the NEAR node. In case of a node failure incident or during the NEAR mainnet upgrade period, the automatic failover system directs users\\\\\\\\\\\\' requests to a backup node, ensuring continuous network operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have developed and maintained the Near Explorer for 2 years, as well as the Near Explorer API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\n* Partnerships with major blockchains to support infrastructure. \\\\\\\\n* Built-in marketplace that highlights important projects in the Web3 industry.\\\\\\\\n* Our clients are leading developers in building ecosystems on blockchains such as TON, Solana, Ethereum, BSC, and others (Trust Wallet, Elliptic, Chainlink, etc.).\\\\\\\\n* Providing tutorials, webinars, and documentation to help users master blockchain technologies and GetBlock services.\\\\\\\\n* Making strategic alliances with tech firms, blockchain projects, and educational institutions to expand services and reach.\\\\\\\\n* Actively engaging with blockchain and developer communities via forums, social media, and events\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\nWe have a highly experienced team of DevOps and Backend Developers working on the deployment and maintenance of the node infrastructure. Each team members\\\\\\\\u{2019} experience ranges from 3 up to 10 years in the development field, most of which are years closely related to blockchain development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* (Design, UX/UI?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (Project management?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (Customer support?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (BD / Marketing?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n* [GetBlock Explorer ](https://getblock.io/explorers/) is our primary project, which we support and aim to develop as a multi-chain explorer. Currently, we support 4 blockchains.\\\\\\\\n* [Faucet](https://getblock.io/faucet/) is a project where we help developers obtain test tokens for free to test their applications and smart contracts. ETH Sepolia and MATIC Amaoy are available for 9 different protocols.\\\\\\\\n* [Marketplace](https://getblock.io/marketplace/) is a project for publishing popular and completely new Web3 applications. It helps users discover the advantages of these applications and quickly compare them with one another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, alongside our explorer, there are two other explorers for NEAR: Nearblocks and Pikespeak. Both have proven functionality, and we believe it is wise to build upon it. We are focused on improving the user interface and UX, and we also believe that data completeness can be a decisive factor in the adoption of our solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt present, we are conducting interviews with the blockchain\\\\\\\\\\\\'s custdev community to assess specific issues and needs related to the use of explorers. This will help better define the product-market fit of GetBlock Explorer for NEAR. We aim to address these issues in the development of our product and are very open to any ideas you might have regarding suggestions and requirements from the NEAR community that could be applied to the explorer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Q1, 2022, we have been supporting GetBlock Explorer for NEAR and the Explorer API to enable any developer to quickly access data and easily develop their DApps.\\\\\\\\nOur ultimate goal is to develop an explorer with cross-chain functionality. We believe that every user should be able to assess their portfolio composition and track asset movements within a unified interface of our explorer.\\\\\\\\nWe support and plan to enhance our Explorer API source code. The documentation can be accessed [here](https://getblock.io/docs/getblock-explorer/get-started/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Target audience\\\\\\\\nThe target audience is basically anyone in the NEAR community who may need to check on transactions, stats, blocks, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nOur primary goal is to create an ecosystem for NEAR users and developers where they can access all the necessary information in real-time. Currently, we are experiencing increased demand on our infrastructure. To develop and maintain our public infrastructure, we need to scale up our capacity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Databases:**\\\\\\\\n* As part of this project, we will test the concept of using Cassandra and ClickHouse in comparison with PostgreSQL and choose the most productive and efficient solution.\\\\\\\\n* After the comparison, we will implement one of the best practices with optimal blockchain data processing and cost reduction. Work stages include:\\\\\\\\n - Developing the system architecture based on the chosen solution (Cassandra, ClickHouse, or PostgreSQL).\\\\\\\\n - Transferring existing data to the new system.\\\\\\\\n- Restructuring data for maximum performance and efficiency.\\\\\\\\n- Creating and optimizing extraction, transformation, and loading processes.\\\\\\\\n-  Setting up system performance monitoring, regular optimization, and database parameter tuning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost Reduction of Hosts:**\\\\\\\\n* Reevaluate the operation of the explorer to reduce host costs. This is necessary for product scaling and adding new features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Addition and support of third-party protocols:**\\\\\\\\n* Solana\\\\\\\\n* Tron\\\\\\\\n* Polygon\\\\\\\\n* etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Adding New Features:**\\\\\\\\n* Token viewing\\\\\\\\n* Token transfer\\\\\\\\n* NFT viewing\\\\\\\\n* NFT transfer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Marketing Support:**\\\\\\\\n* Provide marketing support for projects built on or using the NEAR blockchain (social media announcements, blog posts, marketplace, interviews and AMAs, etc).\\\\\\\\n* GetBlock is eager to support the NEAR  ecosystem and drive further attention to its infrastructure. One way to achieve this is by providing a technical sponsorship for the hackathons organized or sponsored by NEAR. One of the critical components for a successful hackathon is providing the necessary infrastructure for developers to build and test their projects. GetBlock is offering to allocate NEAR nodes with unlimited RPC requests for all hackathon participants, which will allow them to save time and focus on building their projects and developing skills.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nThe key success metrics we highlight are:\\\\\\\\n* Total of unique users\\\\\\\\n* User retention\\\\\\\\nWe believe these metrics will help increase the user base of NEAR and highlight the best projects within the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA detailed roadmap will be created for all stages. Each release will be accompanied by a marketing announcement. NEAR will receive continuous updates as GetBlock adds new functionality/protocols.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\nWe identify several segments among our competitors:\\\\\\\\n1. Explorers built exclusively for NEAR\\\\\\\\n* https://nearblocks.io/ru/address/trader-near.near\\\\\\\\n* https://pikespeak.ai/\\\\\\\\n2. Explorers for other protocols or multi-chain applications\\\\\\\\n* https://blockchair.com/\\\\\\\\n* https://www.oklink.com/\\\\\\\\n* https://etherscan.io/\\\\\\\\n* https://tronscan.org\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$180,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\nTo maintain the infrastructure, providing R&D, we are asking for $15,000/month. This amount will cover:\\\\\\\\n* Payment of current infrastructure expenses\\\\\\\\n* Work on updating the current database\\\\\\\\n* Development stages for adding new features (once every 2-3 months)\\\\\\\\n* Human resources\\\\\\\\n* Marketing\\\\\\\\nIn the future, we hope to reduce infrastructure costs and maintain it with a budget of up to $4,000/month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nP.S. The addition of new protocols is not included in the cost and will be carried out by our own efforts.\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"getblock.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"180000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Explorers\"]}"

We want to build a tool for the entire community that will facilitate on-chain data and high-end analytics in an easy-to-read and to-understand format fit for both newbies and crypto-savvy individuals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\nWe support the dedicated and shared RPC node infrastructure for NEAR so that all the ecosystem developers and projects can quickly access the NEAR network without setting up their own infrastructure.\\\\\\\\nGetBlock has been providing RPCs for NEAR since Q1 2022 and has achieved and provides service reliability of 99.9% for Q2 2024. The duplicate NEAR nodes setup and the automatic failover system ensure the stability of the NEAR node. In case of a node failure incident or during the NEAR mainnet upgrade period, the automatic failover system directs users\\\\\\\\\\\\' requests to a backup node, ensuring continuous network operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have developed and maintained the Near Explorer for 2 years, as well as the Near Explorer API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Non-technical capabilities:\\\\\\\\n* Partnerships with major blockchains to support infrastructure. \\\\\\\\n* Built-in marketplace that highlights important projects in the Web3 industry.\\\\\\\\n* Our clients are leading developers in building ecosystems on blockchains such as TON, Solana, Ethereum, BSC, and others (Trust Wallet, Elliptic, Chainlink, etc.).\\\\\\\\n* Providing tutorials, webinars, and documentation to help users master blockchain technologies and GetBlock services.\\\\\\\\n* Making strategic alliances with tech firms, blockchain projects, and educational institutions to expand services and reach.\\\\\\\\n* Actively engaging with blockchain and developer communities via forums, social media, and events\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\nWe have a highly experienced team of DevOps and Backend Developers working on the deployment and maintenance of the node infrastructure. Each team members\\\\\\\\u{2019} experience ranges from 3 up to 10 years in the development field, most of which are years closely related to blockchain development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* (Design, UX/UI?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (Project management?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (Customer support?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n* (BD / Marketing?) - Yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n* [GetBlock Explorer ](https://getblock.io/explorers/) is our primary project, which we support and aim to develop as a multi-chain explorer. Currently, we support 4 blockchains.\\\\\\\\n* [Faucet](https://getblock.io/faucet/) is a project where we help developers obtain test tokens for free to test their applications and smart contracts. ETH Sepolia and MATIC Amaoy are available for 9 different protocols.\\\\\\\\n* [Marketplace](https://getblock.io/marketplace/) is a project for publishing popular and completely new Web3 applications. It helps users discover the advantages of these applications and quickly compare them with one another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, alongside our explorer, there are two other explorers for NEAR: Nearblocks and Pikespeak. Both have proven functionality, and we believe it is wise to build upon it. We are focused on improving the user interface and UX, and we also believe that data completeness can be a decisive factor in the adoption of our solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt present, we are conducting interviews with the blockchain\\\\\\\\\\\\'s custdev community to assess specific issues and needs related to the use of explorers. This will help better define the product-market fit of GetBlock Explorer for NEAR. We aim to address these issues in the development of our product and are very open to any ideas you might have regarding suggestions and requirements from the NEAR community that could be applied to the explorer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Q1, 2022, we have been supporting GetBlock Explorer for NEAR and the Explorer API to enable any developer to quickly access data and easily develop their DApps.\\\\\\\\nOur ultimate goal is to develop an explorer with cross-chain functionality. We believe that every user should be able to assess their portfolio composition and track asset movements within a unified interface of our explorer.\\\\\\\\nWe support and plan to enhance our Explorer API source code. The documentation can be accessed [here](https://getblock.io/docs/getblock-explorer/get-started/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Target audience\\\\\\\\nThe target audience is basically anyone in the NEAR community who may need to check on transactions, stats, blocks, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nOur primary goal is to create an ecosystem for NEAR users and developers where they can access all the necessary information in real-time. Currently, we are experiencing increased demand on our infrastructure. To develop and maintain our public infrastructure, we need to scale up our capacity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Databases:**\\\\\\\\n* As part of this project, we will test the concept of using Cassandra and ClickHouse in comparison with PostgreSQL and choose the most productive and efficient solution.\\\\\\\\n* After the comparison, we will implement one of the best practices with optimal blockchain data processing and cost reduction. Work stages include:\\\\\\\\n - Developing the system architecture based on the chosen solution (Cassandra, ClickHouse, or PostgreSQL).\\\\\\\\n - Transferring existing data to the new system.\\\\\\\\n- Restructuring data for maximum performance and efficiency.\\\\\\\\n- Creating and optimizing extraction, transformation, and loading processes.\\\\\\\\n-  Setting up system performance monitoring, regular optimization, and database parameter tuning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost Reduction of Hosts:**\\\\\\\\n* Reevaluate the operation of the explorer to reduce host costs. This is necessary for product scaling and adding new features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Addition and support of third-party protocols:**\\\\\\\\n* Solana\\\\\\\\n* Tron\\\\\\\\n* Polygon\\\\\\\\n* etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Adding New Features:**\\\\\\\\n* Token viewing\\\\\\\\n* Token transfer\\\\\\\\n* NFT viewing\\\\\\\\n* NFT transfer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Marketing Support:**\\\\\\\\n* Provide marketing support for projects built on or using the NEAR blockchain (social media announcements, blog posts, marketplace, interviews and AMAs, etc).\\\\\\\\n* GetBlock is eager to support the NEAR  ecosystem and drive further attention to its infrastructure. One way to achieve this is by providing a technical sponsorship for the hackathons organized or sponsored by NEAR. One of the critical components for a successful hackathon is providing the necessary infrastructure for developers to build and test their projects. GetBlock is offering to allocate NEAR nodes with unlimited RPC requests for all hackathon participants, which will allow them to save time and focus on building their projects and developing skills.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nThe key success metrics we highlight are:\\\\\\\\n* Total of unique users\\\\\\\\n* User retention\\\\\\\\nWe believe these metrics will help increase the user base of NEAR and highlight the best projects within the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA detailed roadmap will be created for all stages. Each release will be accompanied by a marketing announcement. NEAR will receive continuous updates as GetBlock adds new functionality/protocols.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\nWe identify several segments among our competitors:\\\\\\\\n1. Explorers built exclusively for NEAR\\\\\\\\n* https://nearblocks.io/ru/address/trader-near.near\\\\\\\\n* https://pikespeak.ai/\\\\\\\\n2. Explorers for other protocols or multi-chain applications\\\\\\\\n* https://blockchair.com/\\\\\\\\n* https://www.oklink.com/\\\\\\\\n* https://etherscan.io/\\\\\\\\n* https://tronscan.org\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$180,000/year\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\nTo maintain the infrastructure, providing R&D, we are asking for $15,000/month. This amount will cover:\\\\\\\\n* Payment of current infrastructure expenses\\\\\\\\n* Work on updating the current database\\\\\\\\n* Development stages for adding new features (once every 2-3 months)\\\\\\\\n* Human resources\\\\\\\\n* Marketing\\\\\\\\nIn the future, we hope to reduce infrastructure costs and maintain it with a budget of up to $4,000/month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nP.S. The addition of new protocols is not included in the cost and will be carried out by our own efforts.\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"getblock.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"180000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"author_id\": \"getblock.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

Until then, some of that work comes through the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/).  The NEAR Foundation has appointed and endowed the **NEAR Infrastructure Committee** with a mission to improve and maintain the underlying infrastructure so developers can build successful applications on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee consists of various leaders across the NEAR ecosystem.  Its work involves proposing improvements for the NEAR ecosystem via RFPs, considering and voting on community proposals, and getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe GitHub Wiki provides information about the [Infrastructure Committee](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee) (IC) and the [Working Group](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group) (WG), including current members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Process Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance, upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline new ideas to tackle, urgent problems to solve, or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals in response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions and innovations are crucial to our collective success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally, the process proceeds as follows;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You draft the proposal. Working Group and Committee members are free to review and offer suggestions.\\\\\\\\n2. Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee members.\\\\\\\\n3. In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\\\\\\\\n4. If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline. You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves providing your personal or company information for verification purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is correct.\\\\\\\\n5. Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on our [Github repo](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group) where the community tracks progress on our [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6).

This subjective approach helps us be honest, decisive, and unrestrained in our ability to effect change in the NEAR ecosystem.  All RFPs, proposals, committee decisions, and funding allocations are published for community transparency and accountability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, the Committee greatly appreciates proposals that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Add new capabilities to the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n* Fill in gaps or address challenges faced by NEAR builders and users\\\\\\\\n* Bring new developers or users into the NEAR ecosystem\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally speaking, the Committee believes infrastructure providers in the NEAR ecosystem should be economically self-sustaining, with a business model that does not rely on continuous grants from the Committee or other funding bodies.  For instance, we have rejected proposals from RPC providers to fund all setup and operation of RPC nodes so that developers would get free access to RPC services.  But we are open to alternate arrangements, such as loans to help cover initial setup costs and grants in exchange for service credits we (or the NEAR Foundation) can distribute to NEAR builders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are also eager to fund projects that benefit the ecosystem but have no direct revenue potential, such as open-source libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOften, a blockchain business involves creating some new open-source specification or protocol and then building a for-profit business on top of that protocol.

Until then, some of that work comes through the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/).  The NEAR Foundation has appointed and endowed the **NEAR Infrastructure Committee** with a mission to improve and maintain the underlying infrastructure so developers can build successful applications on NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee consists of various leaders across the NEAR ecosystem.  Its work involves proposing improvements for the NEAR ecosystem via RFPs, considering and voting on community proposals, and getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe GitHub Wiki provides information about the [Infrastructure Committee](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee) (IC) and the [Working Group](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group) (WG), including current members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Process Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance, upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline new ideas to tackle, urgent problems to solve, or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals in response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions and innovations are crucial to our collective success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally, the process proceeds as follows;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You draft the proposal. Working Group and Committee members are free to review and offer suggestions.\\\\\\\\n2. Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee members.\\\\\\\\n3. In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\\\\\\\\n4. If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline. You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves providing your personal or company information for verification purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is correct.\\\\\\\\n5. Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on our [Github repo](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group) where the community tracks progress on our [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6).
