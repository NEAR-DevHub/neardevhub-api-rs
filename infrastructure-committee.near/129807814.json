Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n10. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n11. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders\\\\\\\\n12. As part of this RFP and based on current usage, the goal is to provide this as a public good. Part of this transition strategy may include pushing users to alternatives like FastNEAR API. \\\\\\\\n13. Estimated transition time, not taking into account any KYC or KYB blockers, is 1 week.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.0% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 0.1% of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**:\\\\\\\\n    * *This should be tracked internally and shared with Infrastructure Committee (IC)*\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n        * Better or in line with existing response time.\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n        * Please outline your rate limiting plan to continue to support Kit Wallet as a public good, if applicable. \\\\\\\\n3. **Support**\\\\\\\\n* **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n* **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours. A single point of contact for urgent issues.\\\\\\\\n4. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n* **Data Consistency**: \\\\\\\\n    * Ensure that there is data validation in place (to show proper information). \\\\\\\\n    * Proper backup of data is maintained and the data is up to date. \\\\\\\\n5. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n* **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least 7 days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n* **Versioning**: Ensure that the new API versions will be backward-compatible wherever possible.\\\\\\\\n* Maintenance - Proper updates to the community and stakeholders about any major maintenance which could impact the service, experience and uptime of the API adversely. \\\\\\\\n6. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. \\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n7. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n8. **Failure to Perform:** If Kit Wallet maintenance falls below the performance aforementioned benchmarks, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include upon signing of agreement, upon official transition, 6 month billing period, 12 month billing period, \\\\\\\\u{2026} and so forth. \\\\\\\\n* **Contingency**: Include a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. In the event that expense for providing free or a public good to the NEAR ecosystem, there should be a clear policy to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:** Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol is a plus.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:** Demonstrate that your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building and maintaining this infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternatives to Kit Wallet;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Fast NEAR API Server: [https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) (hosted free alternative)\\\\\\\\n* Pagoda enhanced api: [https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/](https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/) \\\\\\\\n* NEARBlocks api: [https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory](https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory) \\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet ZMQ Indexer [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer)  \\\\\\\\n* [Mintbase Indexer](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support;** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Indexer Working Group [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kit Wallet Resources;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Past Proposals;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet [https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.

Pavel has experience running large-scale, multi-quarter projects across multiple teams involving data-intensive applications with high SLAs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Design, UX/UI\\\\\\\\n    * For this RFP, we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t need Design or UX work. However, we have preliminary agreements with existing Pagoda designers to help with design work if necessary.\\\\\\\\n* Project management\\\\\\\\n    * Pavel Kudinov will be handling project management\\\\\\\\n* Customer support\\\\\\\\n    * Eduardo and Pavel will share handling customer support. Based on our experience so far, there are not many daily requests.\\\\\\\\n* BD / Marketing\\\\\\\\n    * Pavel and Eduardo have experience with BD and partnership management from our consulting experience. For Marketing, we will rely on external partners known in the NEAR ecosystem when required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor this RFP, the most relevant is that we had been working with NEAR Lake for 2 years and significantly contributed to many tools running on top of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlockLake Inc will be focusing on the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* raw blockchain data extraction, hosting, and serving;\\\\\\\\n* building data pipelines for analytics, powering Near Foundation, Dune and BigQuery;\\\\\\\\n* critical APIs for most popular and essential use cases, such as native and FT token balance history;\\\\\\\\n* consulting services for external clients;\\\\\\\\n* In the future, multichain indexing and APIs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The main approach and solution of the proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Take over existing infrastructure for NEAR Lake: hosting NEAR Indexer nodes and the S3 bucket.\\\\\\\\n2. Utilize our expertise to build better and even cheaper access tools for people using NEAR Lake and offering it based on subscription:\\\\\\\\n    1. Block index to query only relevant blocks\\\\\\\\n    2. Block and transaction streaming through WebSockets and/or Webhooks\\\\\\\\n3. Take over critical data pipelines for integrating Dune (and maintaining ~$350k annual savings) and BigQuery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why should the committee choose this project?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The team behind this proposal has profound knowledge of the domain and technical architecture. Zero migration and onboarding costs.\\\\\\\\n2. Internal and External users rely on the high-quality datasets that we already built; other data sources are not as reliable. Data Analytics and AI use cases require high-quality data.\\\\\\\\n3. Dune\\\\\\\\u{2019}s proposal cost was reduced by 50% only because we did most of the work on the NEAR Lakehouse.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Will this solution be open source? What licensing will be used?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will keep the same open source license that NEAR GitHub repos have currently for all public goods code \\\\\\\\u{2013} the NEAR Lake, client libraries and data pipelines.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* By February 2025\\\\\\\\n    * Incorporate the company, establish operations\\\\\\\\n    * Takeover existing Lake infrastructure as is with existing costs, ensuring non-disruptive transition of all existing clients\\\\\\\\n    * Replace Databricks with the cheaper alternative to empower Dune and BigQuery use-cases\\\\\\\\n* By July 2025\\\\\\\\n    * First revenue from consulting services and custom indexers\\\\\\\\n    * First revenue from NEAR Streams \\\\\\\\u{2013} a cheaper way to stream transactions to clients, reducing network costs and latency.\\\\\\\\n    * Reduction of infrastructure costs to run NEAR Lake (using dedicated servers)\\\\\\\\n* By December 2025\\\\\\\\n    * Expand the Lake for another blockchain(s)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Service Level Agreements \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Support\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n* **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours\\\\\\\\n* **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues to the users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Legal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Terms & Conditions:** We will provide a clear T&C and Privacy Policy facilitating fair usage of services, following best practices.\\\\\\\\n* **Fair Use Policy**: Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n* **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service.

Pavel has experience running large-scale, multi-quarter projects across multiple teams involving data-intensive applications with high SLAs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Design, UX/UI\\\\\\\\n    * For this RFP, we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t need Design or UX work. However, we have preliminary agreements with existing Pagoda designers to help with design work if necessary.\\\\\\\\n* Project management\\\\\\\\n    * Pavel Kudinov will be handling project management\\\\\\\\n* Customer support\\\\\\\\n    * Eduardo and Pavel will share handling customer support.

For Marketing, we will rely on external partners known in the NEAR ecosystem when required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Portfolio of relevant work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor this RFP, the most relevant is that we had been working with NEAR Lake for 2 years and significantly contributed to many tools running on top of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlockLake Inc will be focusing on the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* raw blockchain data extraction, hosting, and serving;\\\\\\\\n* building data pipelines for analytics, powering Near Foundation, Dune and BigQuery;\\\\\\\\n* critical APIs for most popular and essential use cases, such as native and FT token balance history;\\\\\\\\n* consulting services for external clients;\\\\\\\\n* In the future, multichain indexing and APIs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The main approach and solution of the proposal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Take over existing infrastructure for NEAR Lake: hosting NEAR Indexer nodes and the S3 bucket.\\\\\\\\n2. Utilize our expertise to build better and even cheaper access tools for people using NEAR Lake and offering it based on subscription:\\\\\\\\n    1. Block index to query only relevant blocks\\\\\\\\n    2. Block and transaction streaming through WebSockets and/or Webhooks\\\\\\\\n3. Take over critical data pipelines for integrating Dune (and maintaining ~$350k annual savings) and BigQuery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why should the committee choose this project?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The team behind this proposal has profound knowledge of the domain and technical architecture. Zero migration and onboarding costs.\\\\\\\\n2. Internal and External users rely on the high-quality datasets that we already built; other data sources are not as reliable. Data Analytics and AI use cases require high-quality data.\\\\\\\\n3. Dune\\\\\\\\u{2019}s proposal cost was reduced by 50% only because we did most of the work on the NEAR Lakehouse.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Will this solution be open source?

This works well for front-end clients which come from the different IPs. This setup has quite low cost overhead, but it can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used to minimize GEO-spatial latency. There is a latency overhead, because each request might be routed not to the closest server, but instead to a server on a different continent. While it does increase latency by up to ~140ms, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t consider it significant enough to justify costs associated with geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Expected load\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- ~12500 RPS\\\\\\\\n- 32.4B requests per month\\\\\\\\n- 93TB per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost load balancer providers have costs associated with the number of requests. While GCP doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t charge for the number of requests, it has limitations of load balancing across external endpoints and does charge for the traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*Note, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have enough experience with GCP load-balancing, so some assumptions might be wrong.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have considered the following options for this proposal:\\\\\\\\n1. Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n3. **PREFERRED** Cloudflare Enterprise geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n4. Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing with proxy instances or GCP LB with simple traffic splitting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #1: Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use a CNAME record for each of the near.org endpoints to point to our endpoints(s).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis option might be fairly simple to setup at **no extra cost**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote, Strict rate-limiting on HTTP referer will require extra work on nodes or an enterprise plan.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #2: Cloudflare Enterprise Load-balancing (CF LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple DNS-based load-balancing can be upgraded to geo-spatial load-balancing at our end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the communication with Cloudflare sales, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve received an estimate for 15B requests per month. Scaling it up to 32.4B requests, the price might be around **~$6000 per month**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCloudflare enterprise offers rate limiting based on HTTP headers, including HTTP Referer or HTTP Origin.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #3: Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing (GCP LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP external load balancer has bandwidth associated with it. \\\\\\\\nBased on our estimates, the LB traffic is around $10 per TB for ingress, and $10 per TB for egress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP LB can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used for geo-spatial balancing without additional nodes on GCP or other cloud run/functions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo there are 2 options for GCP:\\\\\\\\n- Full load-balancing. Requires RPC egress traffic with proxy nodes. Costs *estimated* **~$16000 per month**\\\\\\\\n- Splitting traffic (no geo-spatial routing). Costs around **~$2000 month**.

Resulting in 320M calls per day.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Reliability and Security\\\\\\\\n- Experienced in handling:\\\\\\\\n  - Traffic surges of 30,000 RPS\\\\\\\\n  - DDoS attacks (recently)\\\\\\\\n  - Provider outages\\\\\\\\n- ~100% RPCs uptime for the last 3 months\\\\\\\\n- 250ms p95 over 60min view call latency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![latency monitoring](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/e873bdfb-b4fd-440e-a462-e7028e26ce8d)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Monitoring and Performance\\\\\\\\n- Internal monitoring and alert systems\\\\\\\\n- Global RPC latency monitoring dashboards\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Hardware\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the current usage of the following:\\\\\\\\n- RPC Mainnet - 10k requests/s (while currently 6k RPS)\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archival Mainnet - 2k requests/s\\\\\\\\n- RPC Testnet - 400 requests/s\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archival Testnet - 150 requests/s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe recommend the following setup:\\\\\\\\n- RPC Mainnet: 20 nodes (estimating 500 RPS each)\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archival Mainnet: 4 full NVME nodes, with 10Gbps (at 500 RPS)\\\\\\\\n- RPC Testnet - 4 nodes (for 2X redundancy)\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archival Testnet - 2 full NVME nodes (for 2X redundancy)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote, that we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t rely on the read-rpc for this setup, due to the current setup complexity. We may consider switching to read-rpc over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Pricing**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThree types of servers:\\\\\\\\n- RPC (mainnet/testnet): $250 with 2Tb NVME + 1Gbps\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archive Mainnet: $2500 with 90Tb NVME + ~250TB of 10Gpbs traffic\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archive Testnet: $1000 with ~20Tb NVME + 1Gbps\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal:\\\\\\\\n- 24 RPC nodes: $6000\\\\\\\\n- 4 Mainnet Archival nodes: $10000\\\\\\\\n- 2 Testnet Archival nodes: $2000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Total: $18000 per month**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Load-balancing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur current RPC setup is using a simple DNS-based load balancer. This works well for front-end clients which come from the different IPs. This setup has quite low cost overhead, but it can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used to minimize GEO-spatial latency. There is a latency overhead, because each request might be routed not to the closest server, but instead to a server on a different continent. While it does increase latency by up to ~140ms, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t consider it significant enough to justify costs associated with geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Expected load\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- ~12500 RPS\\\\\\\\n- 32.4B requests per month\\\\\\\\n- 93TB per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost load balancer providers have costs associated with the number of requests. While GCP doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t charge for the number of requests, it has limitations of load balancing across external endpoints and does charge for the traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*Note, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have enough experience with GCP load-balancing, so some assumptions might be wrong.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have considered the following options for this proposal:\\\\\\\\n1. Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n3. **PREFERRED** Cloudflare Enterprise geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n4. Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing with proxy instances or GCP LB with simple traffic splitting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #1: Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use a CNAME record for each of the near.org endpoints to point to our endpoints(s).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis option might be fairly simple to setup at **no extra cost**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote, Strict rate-limiting on HTTP referer will require extra work on nodes or an enterprise plan.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #2: Cloudflare Enterprise Load-balancing (CF LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple DNS-based load-balancing can be upgraded to geo-spatial load-balancing at our end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the communication with Cloudflare sales, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve received an estimate for 15B requests per month. Scaling it up to 32.4B requests, the price might be around **~$6000 per month**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCloudflare enterprise offers rate limiting based on HTTP headers, including HTTP Referer or HTTP Origin.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #3: Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing (GCP LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP external load balancer has bandwidth associated with it. \\\\\\\\nBased on our estimates, the LB traffic is around $10 per TB for ingress, and $10 per TB for egress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP LB can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used for geo-spatial balancing without additional nodes on GCP or other cloud run/functions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo there are 2 options for GCP:\\\\\\\\n- Full load-balancing. Requires RPC egress traffic with proxy nodes. Costs *estimated* **~$16000 per month**\\\\\\\\n- Splitting traffic (no geo-spatial routing). Costs around **~$2000 month**. Need to confirm feasibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Setup (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n    - Setup RPC nodes and Archival RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n    - Setup 4 endpoints to point traffic\\\\\\\\n    - Rate-limiters based on IPs\\\\\\\\n- Status page for new endpoints (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Setup external monitoring dashboard (4 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Setup CF LB (4-8 weeks)\\\\\\\\n    - Negotiate deal with CF for LB\\\\\\\\n    - Setup rate limiter based on the HTTP referer.\\\\\\\\n- Full endpoints migration if necessary (3-6 months)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Requests per second\\\\\\\\n    - All request types (expected to handle steady traffic of 12,500 RPS)\\\\\\\\n    - Function calls (majority of requests)\\\\\\\\n    - TX status\\\\\\\\n    - Broadcast TX\\\\\\\\n- Latency\\\\\\\\n    - Mean latency from 3 geo endpoints (~170ms for view calls)\\\\\\\\n    - P95 latency (~250ms for calls)\\\\\\\\n    - Lower mean/p95 latency after CF LB\\\\\\\\n- Rate limiting (number of throttled calls)\\\\\\\\n- Traffic (expected up to 3Tb per day)\\\\\\\\n- Uptime (expected 99.99%)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Compensation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor maintenance and development we ask for $12,000 a month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$36,000 per month (paid monthly) for the duration of 6 months.\\\\\\\\n- $18,000 nodes\\\\\\\\n- $6,000 CF LB\\\\\\\\n- $12,000 maintenance \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter 6 months, we expect a significant drop in the usage, so we should re-negotiate a deal based on the new requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"treasury.fastnear.tg\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"216000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": []}"

But there are still many [non-custodial](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector) and exchange wallets that depend on the Kit Wallet Indexer service or that we are still confirming their usage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not have data available which NEAR ecosystem projects are currently using Kit Wallet Indexer but these should include wallets and exchanges and any projects that need to quickly query different token balances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEcosystem projects that have already  transitioned off of Kit Wallet to better-maintained services include [Nightly](https://nightly.app/), [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/), MyNEARWallet, NEAR Mobile Wallet, and [Bitte/Mintbase Wallet](wallet.bitte.ai).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Monitoring, Alerting, Reporting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* \\\\\\\\u{200b}\\\\\\\\u{200b}Real-time monitoring of system health and performance with public forward facing status page\\\\\\\\n* Alerts for data inconsistencies or indexing delays and public channel & direct communication with major stakeholders using service\\\\\\\\n* Internal Dashboard for visualizing system metrics\\\\\\\\n* Weekly progress reports during the transition phase to Infrastructure committee asynchronous \\\\\\\\n* Quarterly performance and usage reports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**As part of this transition, maintenance, and proposals, please include;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Comprehensive system architecture documentation\\\\\\\\n* API documentation including usage examples (mentioning the service will be deprecated and linked to alternative solutions like _[FastNear](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) _) \\\\\\\\n* User guide for common queries and use cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Transition Steps for selected vendor\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Review and understand the current Kit Wallet Indexer API infrastructure (including accompanying infra like NEAR Lake) and processes.\\\\\\\\n2. Include detailed transition plan,in your milestones\\\\\\\\n3. Set up necessary access and permissions for the new team.\\\\\\\\n4. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the current Pagoda team.\\\\\\\\n5. Implement and test any necessary changes or improvements to the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\n6. Perform thorough testing to ensure data integrity and system performance.\\\\\\\\n7. Update all relevant documentation.\\\\\\\\n8. Gradually transition operational responsibilities.\\\\\\\\n9. Establish new support channels and processes.\\\\\\\\n10. Conduct a final review and handover with the Infrastructure Committee.\\\\\\\\n11. Conduct official communications on your channels and with the NEAR Developer ecosystems and relevant stakeholders\\\\\\\\n12. As part of this RFP and based on current usage, the goal is to provide this as a public good. Part of this transition strategy may include pushing users to alternatives like FastNEAR API. \\\\\\\\n13. Estimated transition time, not taking into account any KYC or KYB blockers, is 1 week.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Service Level Agreements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Availability**\\\\\\\\n    * **Uptime Guarantee**: 99.0% monthly uptime\\\\\\\\n    * **Downtime Allowance**: Up to 0.1% of downtime per month\\\\\\\\n2. **Performance**:\\\\\\\\n    * *This should be tracked internally and shared with Infrastructure Committee (IC)*\\\\\\\\n    * **Response Time**:\\\\\\\\n        * Better or in line with existing response time.\\\\\\\\n    * **Rate Limiting**:\\\\\\\\n        * Please outline your rate limiting plan to continue to support Kit Wallet as a public good, if applicable. \\\\\\\\n3. **Support**\\\\\\\\n* **Support Availability**: Community-based support only (e.g., through forums, GitHub issues, or a developer community Slack/Telegram/Discord channel)\\\\\\\\n* **Response Time**: No guaranteed response time, but best-effort responses within 24-48 hours. A single point of contact for urgent issues.\\\\\\\\n4. **Data Integrity**\\\\\\\\n* **Data Consistency**: \\\\\\\\n    * Ensure that there is data validation in place (to show proper information). \\\\\\\\n    * Proper backup of data is maintained and the data is up to date. \\\\\\\\n5. **Updates and Changes**\\\\\\\\n* **Notice for Breaking Changes**: At least 7 days\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice for any breaking changes in the API or infrastructure\\\\\\\\n* **Versioning**: Ensure that the new API versions will be backward-compatible wherever possible.\\\\\\\\n* Maintenance - Proper updates to the community and stakeholders about any major maintenance which could impact the service, experience and uptime of the API adversely. \\\\\\\\n6. **Limitations**\\\\\\\\n    * **No SLA Credits**: No financial credits or compensation for outages or performance issues for free public good services. \\\\\\\\n    * **Fair Use Policy**: Provide Explicit statements about the intended use for development and the prohibition of production workloads\\\\\\\\n7. **Termination Rights**: The right to suspend or terminate the service for users who exceed fair use or misuse the service. IC must be informed about these.\\\\\\\\n8. **Failure to Perform:** If Kit Wallet maintenance falls below the performance aforementioned benchmarks, the Infrastructure Committee has the right to transition this public good to another vendor. The current maintainer will be required to facilitate the transition. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Guidelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Budget**: Proposals should outline a **detailed budget**. A clear breakdown of costs, including development, testing, documentation, maintenance & support, infrastructure, 3rd party services and external API costs. Maintenance cost should be calculated accurately based on provided usage information and existing software costs. Being able to properly assess a budget based on usage is a major factor for qualifying legitimate vendors.\\\\\\\\n* **Milestones**: Please highlight the details of the various milestones that are included in your development plan and relevant budgets attached to each milestone. Any metrics around success of the milestone (acceptance criterion) should also be included. Milestone examples include upon signing of agreement, upon official transition, 6 month billing period, 12 month billing period, \\\\\\\\u{2026} and so forth. \\\\\\\\n* **Contingency**: Include a contingency plan for potential overruns or unexpected expenses. In the event that expense for providing free or a public good to the NEAR ecosystem, there should be a clear policy to report expenses incurred by NEAR usage to cover additional costs and prove that costs exceeded previous budgets. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Experience:** Proven experience in big data processing, cloud infrastructure management, and blockchain data indexing, preferably within the blockchain or fintech sectors. Experience working with NEAR Protocol is a plus.\\\\\\\\n* **Portfolio:** Examples of previous work and case studies demonstrating success in similar projects.\\\\\\\\n* **Team:** A skilled team comprising developers, data engineers, and support staff with relevant experience.\\\\\\\\n* **Relevant Business:** Demonstrate that your team has an existing business that would motivate you to continue building and maintaining this infrastructure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternatives to Kit Wallet;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Fast NEAR API Server: [https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs](https://github.com/fastnear/fastnear-api-server-rs) (hosted free alternative)\\\\\\\\n* Pagoda enhanced api: [https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/](https://console.pagoda.co/apis?tab=enhancedApi#/) \\\\\\\\n* NEARBlocks api: [https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory](https://api.nearblocks.io/v1/account/rektdegen.near/inventory) \\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet ZMQ Indexer [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer)  \\\\\\\\n* [Mintbase Indexer](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) [https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer](https://github.com/here-wallet/near-zmq-indexer) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Support;** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* NEAR Indexer Working Group [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-data) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Kit Wallet Resources;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints API: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n* Indexer Endpoints Code: [https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper/blob/master/src/middleware/indexer.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Past Proposals;**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* HERE Wallet [https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-develop-public-near-indexer-from-here-wallet-team-compatible-with-kitwallet-api/37307)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Process\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**[Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7iAT9tWngik9JPS_GadCCEB5nZtA2AiL2yWZoBGMFM/pub)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should submit a proposal in response to this RFP on the Infrastructure Committee Portal.
