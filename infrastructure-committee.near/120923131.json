Vertical slicing in agile breakdown refers to the practice of dividing work into thin, end-to-end slices that cut through all layers of the system to deliver a complete, functional piece of user value. Each vertical slice represents a small, independent feature or a user story that can be implemented, tested, and delivered to users.\\\\\\\\nHere are the key points about vertical slicing:\\\\\\\\n- Each vertical slice encompasses all necessary components (e.g., user interface, business logic, database interactions) to deliver a fully functional feature.\\\\\\\\n- The primary goal is to deliver tangible user value with each increment. This approach ensures that every slice results in a usable piece of software.\\\\\\\\n- Vertical slicing aligns with agile principles of incremental and iterative development, enabling us to deliver small, manageable pieces of functionality frequently.\\\\\\\\n- Vertical slicing encourages collaboration among team members with different expertise (e.g., frontend, backend, QA) to ensure that each slice is fully functional and integrated.\\\\\\\\n- By delivering complete features frequently, we can gather user feedback early and often, allowing for quicker adjustments and improvements.\\\\\\\\n- Since each vertical slice is a self-contained feature, integration issues are minimized compared to horizontal slicing, where different components must be integrated later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe utilize an Agile approach with standard ceremonies (stand-up, grooming, refinement, review, retro). We will have 2-weeks sprints and we welcome Committee representatives to participate in our backlog management routines or review if needed. We aim to deliver tangible value each sprint and a practical piece of the end-to-end journey for each milestone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe use Figma for the design. Reference for the style that will be used can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/Gaa51AGWBRTyKXF6TE2sjY/Astra%2B%2B-(Mobile)?node-id=0-1&t=CJlkI50FetgIrHtV-0).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Solution overview\\\\\\\\nThe solution has four architectural components:\\\\\\\\n- Stable Sputnik DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- DAO contract created through the Sputnik DAO contract (%dao_name%.sputnik\\\\\\\\u{2026})\\\\\\\\n- BOS UI\\\\\\\\n- Open-source js backend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBOS UI features:\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-1]** Mobile first with adaptive design for the desktop\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-2]** Wizard to create/disable DAO (new UX and implementation). Default user flow will create a DAO with 2 pre-set groups - Council and Members.\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-3]** UI to define legislative proposal routines. \\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.1]** Add/delete member to the group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.2]** Add/delete group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.3]** Add/delete funding threshold (e.g. if we have 10000, 50000, 10000 we can configure different quorum requirements for intervals 0-10000, 10000-50000, 50000-100000). A quorum requirement can be set for each group and using \\\\\\\\u{201c}AND\\\\\\\\u{201d} or \\\\\\\\u{201c}OR\\\\\\\\u{201d} logical operations e.g. need 60% councils AND 50% members.\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.4]** Add quorum requirement per group/funding threshold\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-4]** UI to browse through legislative proposals with full data available on who voted how on each proposal\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-5]** UI to vote on proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDAO contract features:\\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-1]** Support data structures for DAO management features \\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-2]** Support view methods for the list of proposals \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJS Backend features:\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-1]** Fetch and process data from DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-2]** Cache data for the BOS UI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why should the committee choose this project?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project is in line with the Committee\\\\\\\\\\\\'s priorities and our team has a proven background of delivering solutions in NEAR with similar architecture.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, MIT licensing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe whole project will take three months with monthly milestones\\\\\\\\n- Basic features (**BOS-2,BOS-3.1,BOS-3.2**)\\\\\\\\n- DAO management features (**BOS-3.3, BOS-3.4**)\\\\\\\\n- Browsing and voting (**BOS-4, BOS-5**)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How will we measure success \\\\\\\\nDelivery of end-to-end journeys described in the Goals/Milestone section. We don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have business metrics - only technical definitions of done which include code being available on GitHub under the MIT license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresented functionality is available in Astra++.  We outline several issues which were part of the motivation for the current proposal: \\\\\\\\n- Lack of ownership and absence of long-term vision-strategy for the products. The outcome is that the product becomes a pile of features (like a pizza - similar to what we have in \\\\\\\\u{201c}pizza coding\\\\\\\\u{201d} when developers just pile their code on top of the previous developers without having a single owner and without understanding of the approach that was taken by the previous developer).\\\\\\\\n- Dependency on closed-sourced indexers. Core contracts lacking view methods and data about DAOs is retrieved through an indexer developed by a 3-d party which is a closed source. Indexers in general are very unreliable and are the source of errors. For example, even a mature and well-recognized NEAR indexer built by Pagoda contains data errors which we found during our work - indexers are complicated in NEAR in general and wherever there is a complicated component there is room for an error. Moreover, architecture with indexers hinders scalability drastically, especially closed-sourced indexers.\\\\\\\\n- Lack of UX design - the product looks like a product for developers by developers which raises the entry barrier and results in the creation of DAOs only just to create a formal structure for funds funneling - the interface is not engaging people into the decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe offer to restructure DAO management tools in a completely open sourced fashion with usage of native view methods instead of indexers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$97,500 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Engineering salaries - 81500 USD for 3 months of development. 1 month of full support is included.\\\\\\\\n- Management salaries - 15000 USD for 3 months\\\\\\\\n- Infra/tooling (servers lease, gas costs) - 1000USD\\\\\\\\nTotal - $97,500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Future plans\\\\\\\\nThis proposal addresses the first of the identified gaps in the current user experience in interacting with Sputnik-DAO contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur future plans include the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Incorporate 3rd party applications to provide the functionality to handle general and decision-specific discussions in DAOs. This can be achieved by integrating with Social DB or with centralized applications (e.g. Discord, Zulip, Mattermost, Telegram). This integration requires additional research to provide a holistic approach that would be compatible with other applications that cover different functionality over the Sputnik-DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- Provide a reporting tool that would allow users to generate comprehensive, human-readable reports on funding, payments, and decision making. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth of the points above will be addressed in individual proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"24a2788251373b64d58200665f12b00cfb2d6c9d2dc79b209d39cd0e433f5b3f\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"97500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": [\"Other\"]}"

Default user flow will create a DAO with 2 pre-set groups - Council and Members.\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-3]** UI to define legislative proposal routines. \\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.1]** Add/delete member to the group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.2]** Add/delete group\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.3]** Add/delete funding threshold (e.g. if we have 10000, 50000, 10000 we can configure different quorum requirements for intervals 0-10000, 10000-50000, 50000-100000). A quorum requirement can be set for each group and using \\\\\\\\u{201c}AND\\\\\\\\u{201d} or \\\\\\\\u{201c}OR\\\\\\\\u{201d} logical operations e.g. need 60% councils AND 50% members.\\\\\\\\n  - **[BOS-3.4]** Add quorum requirement per group/funding threshold\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-4]** UI to browse through legislative proposals with full data available on who voted how on each proposal\\\\\\\\n- **[BOS-5]** UI to vote on proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDAO contract features:\\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-1]** Support data structures for DAO management features \\\\\\\\n- **[DAO-2]** Support view methods for the list of proposals \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJS Backend features:\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-1]** Fetch and process data from DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- **[JS-2]** Cache data for the BOS UI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why should the committee choose this project?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project is in line with the Committee\\\\\\\\\\\\'s priorities and our team has a proven background of delivering solutions in NEAR with similar architecture.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, MIT licensing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe whole project will take three months with monthly milestones\\\\\\\\n- Basic features (**BOS-2,BOS-3.1,BOS-3.2**)\\\\\\\\n- DAO management features (**BOS-3.3, BOS-3.4**)\\\\\\\\n- Browsing and voting (**BOS-4, BOS-5**)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How will we measure success \\\\\\\\nDelivery of end-to-end journeys described in the Goals/Milestone section. We don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have business metrics - only technical definitions of done which include code being available on GitHub under the MIT license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresented functionality is available in Astra++.  We outline several issues which were part of the motivation for the current proposal: \\\\\\\\n- Lack of ownership and absence of long-term vision-strategy for the products. The outcome is that the product becomes a pile of features (like a pizza - similar to what we have in \\\\\\\\u{201c}pizza coding\\\\\\\\u{201d} when developers just pile their code on top of the previous developers without having a single owner and without understanding of the approach that was taken by the previous developer).\\\\\\\\n- Dependency on closed-sourced indexers. Core contracts lacking view methods and data about DAOs is retrieved through an indexer developed by a 3-d party which is a closed source. Indexers in general are very unreliable and are the source of errors. For example, even a mature and well-recognized NEAR indexer built by Pagoda contains data errors which we found during our work - indexers are complicated in NEAR in general and wherever there is a complicated component there is room for an error. Moreover, architecture with indexers hinders scalability drastically, especially closed-sourced indexers.\\\\\\\\n- Lack of UX design - the product looks like a product for developers by developers which raises the entry barrier and results in the creation of DAOs only just to create a formal structure for funds funneling - the interface is not engaging people into the decentralized governance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe offer to restructure DAO management tools in a completely open sourced fashion with usage of native view methods instead of indexers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$97,500 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Engineering salaries - 81500 USD for 3 months of development. 1 month of full support is included.\\\\\\\\n- Management salaries - 15000 USD for 3 months\\\\\\\\n- Infra/tooling (servers lease, gas costs) - 1000USD\\\\\\\\nTotal - $97,500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Future plans\\\\\\\\nThis proposal addresses the first of the identified gaps in the current user experience in interacting with Sputnik-DAO contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur future plans include the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Incorporate 3rd party applications to provide the functionality to handle general and decision-specific discussions in DAOs. This can be achieved by integrating with Social DB or with centralized applications (e.g. Discord, Zulip, Mattermost, Telegram). This integration requires additional research to provide a holistic approach that would be compatible with other applications that cover different functionality over the Sputnik-DAO contract\\\\\\\\n- Provide a reporting tool that would allow users to generate comprehensive, human-readable reports on funding, payments, and decision making. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth of the points above will be addressed in individual proposals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"24a2788251373b64d58200665f12b00cfb2d6c9d2dc79b209d39cd0e433f5b3f\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"97500\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"author_id\": \"ftdgoodluck.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
