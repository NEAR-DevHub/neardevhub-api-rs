Additionally, the explorer will include a tokens page, transaction execution plan, gas fee tracker, and display contract source code and methods, all while supporting the NEAR Chain Signature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe estimated timeline for project completion is structured into four phases. Phase 1 involves a two-week research period focused on the NEAR chain and its Chain Signature. During this phase, we will explore NEAR nodes and their RPC endpoints, understand smart contract functionality within NEAR, learn about multichain smart contracts, and determine how data should be organized and displayed to end users. Phase 2, spanning three weeks, will focus on designing the NEAR explorer. This includes how data should be stored, transformed, and indexed, as well as how token transfers and balances should be managed and served. We will also design the user interface for NEAR-specific pages, including execution plans, smart contracts, and tokens. Phase 3, which will take four weeks, involves implementation. This phase will include pulling all historical data from NEAR, running ETL processes to index the data, implementing NEAR-specific UI components, and integrating Chain Signature support. Finally, Phase 4, lasting two weeks, will involve deploying the explorer to production, performing thorough testing, and monitoring the system post-launch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor reference, you can review key features in the following live explorers: zkevm.socialscan.io, linea.socialscan.io, and mantle.socialscan.io.

Additionally, there will be an annual service fee of $200,000 for handling up to 2 billion total transactions. This fee includes ongoing support for the blockchain explorers as outlined in the scope above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal aims to ensure that NEAR receives a robust and user-friendly blockchain explorer, equipped with all necessary features and designed for optimal performance and ease of use.

Together, they delved deep into the intricacies of designing a blockchain network. Regarding his academic credentials, Marijo holds a technical degree in electrical engineering and informatics, with a focus on software robotics and machine learning. Additionally, he earned an executive MBA from the Technical University of Munich.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Alterscope development team consists of a mix of senior and junior developers from the best European technical universities (e.g., Technical University Munich/TUM, Koc University Istanbul, FER Zagreb), with a strong track record in applied research (e.g., working at institutions such as Frauenhofer IIS, IEEE) and practical experience gathered at renowned organizations (e.g., Oracle, SAP Labs, ING, Cisco, Dassault Systems). Notably, Vedran Zivicnjak (Linkedin), the infrastructure lead of Alterscope, has over 15 years of experience in DevOps and previously built critical national IT infrastructures in the area of telecommunications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Benefits for Near**\\\\\\\\nAlterscope\\\\\\\\\\\\'s objective is to provide a comprehensive, real-time view on relevant risk metrics to enable sound due diligence for users, liquidity providers, and developers in the ecosystem of Near. Our core aim is to set Near apart from other ecosystems and to support its vision in, while providing the highest possible degree of security to its users. We are eager to support the Near team in the process of creating a neutral community dashboard that significantly reduces the burden for users and developers to analyze and monitor critical events in the ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, partnering with us provides the following benefits for Near: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tAdvanced Risk Mapping with Proprietary Methodologies: Our developed methodologies allow for precise mapping of dApps and associated risks, achieving multidimensional comparability across various dApp categories within the Near ecosystem. Our solution enhances understanding and visibility of the inherent risks, assisting developers and users in making informed decisions based on robust data sets across different dApps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tUnlocking of Novel Risk Tooling: Alterscope unlocks innovative risk tooling for participants in the Near ecosystem. For instance, being part of Alterscope\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure unlocks our comparison tool that allows for the graphical representation of quantitative metrics across dApps as well as a customizable risk framework tool that enables any user to configure and adapt risk frameworks according to their specific risk tolerance and requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tIncreased Liquidity and Investment Security: With 53% of crypto hedge funds and 43% of traditional hedge funds already involved in liquidity provision strategies, Alterscope addresses top investment barriers such as protocol understanding, security concerns, and perceived complexity. Our tools provide the insights necessary for professional investors to engage confidently, thereby attracting and retaining more TVL in the Near ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tCommunity Empowerment for Risk Research: The traditional DYOR (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do Your Own Research\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") approach falls short. Alterscope puts this approach on new grounds by facilitating comparable, comprehensive research across chains, protocols, and liquidity pools, empowering both the community and professional liquidity providers (LPs) to perform sound risk assessments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, by leveraging Alterscope\\\\\\\\\\\\'s infrastructure, we can set a new standards in terms of operational capabilities, foster a more secure and transparent Near ecosystem, and increase engagement in terms of users, liquidity providers and developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe strength of our solution lies in its real-time capabilities, the ability to integrate diverse parameters from chains, protocols, and various middleware solutions simultaneously, and the opportunity for community collaboration. By aggregating relevant on- and off-chain data, Alterscope provides a multidimensional overview of protocol risks, combined with a no-code risk engine that enables anyone in the community to set up customizable risk frameworks and publicly share them on a marketplace. Our initial focus is on DeFi and Re-Staking applications due to their heightened exposure to risks. However, we are also open to discuss with Near an extension of our risk frameworks to other verticals (e.g., RWA projects, GameFi, SocialFi). By integrating Near-based dApps in the infrastructure of Alterscope, we allow the community to build customizable risk frameworks leveraging over 400 different parameters, addressing risks grounded in the composability and interconnectedness of web3. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs an outlook: We are also progressing towards incorporating zk-proofs into our risk frameworks, enhancing user privacy and augmenting ecosystem protocols with greater intelligence and flexibility. This feature development is intended to be released by end of 2024 with integrated dApps in Alterscope\\\\\\\\u{2019}s infrastructure automatically being enabled to benefit from this innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2003}\\\\\\\\n**3. Project Deliveries**\\\\\\\\nIn the context of this proposal, we plan to systematically establish the foundations for integrating on-chain data from Near and adjusting our backend for being able to onboard Near-based dApps on Alterscope\\\\\\\\u{2019}s platform. We start with configuring our AWS cluster to capture block-level data. A robust ETL pipeline will be implemented, transforming raw data into structured databases for real-time data processing. This setup enables dynamic analytics with statistical and machine learning models. Parallelly, we will craft visually engaging dashboards, optimized for network data to enhance the user experience. The process culminates with extensive testing and documentation, ensuring the reliability of the setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey Deliverables\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\\\\\tBackend Infrastructure Setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tDevelop a backend system ready to integrate Near-based dApps and include a dedicated Alterscope ecosystem dashboard for Near.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tKey Outcome: Enable calculation of risk metrics around tokenomics, liquidity, decentralization of dApps, and monitoring of on-chain-specific risks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tMeasured by: Successful integration and functional dashboard display.\\\\\\\\n2.\\\\\\\\tData Pipelines and API Endpoints:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tConfiguration of AWS clusters to capture and process block-level data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tCreation of ETL pipelines to transform raw data into actionable insights.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tSetup of API endpoints for seamless interaction with Near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ecosystem portal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tMeasured by: Data syncing in real-time with the Near network and API functionality.\\\\\\\\n3.\\\\\\\\tReal-Time Data Processing and Visualization:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tImplementation of advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for real-time data processing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tDevelopment of visually engaging, dynamic dashboards to enhance user experience and data interaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tMeasurable by: Real-time processing capabilities and dashboard usability.\\\\\\\\n4.\\\\\\\\tTesting, Documentation, and Launch Preparation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tComprehensive testing across all systems to ensure reliability and performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tDetailed documentation outlining key features, usage, and technical specifications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\u{2022}\\\\\\\\tMeasured by: Detailed technical documentation published.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe suggest a project commencement date set for July 2024 and a finalization until end of July 2024.

We provide the quickest, easiest and cheapest way to buy/sell stablecoins. We currently support stablecoins on ERC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BASE, Solana and SX networks. This is the first time that users can buy stablecoins in Canada directly on the network of their choice, without having to jump through hoops/bridging etc. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur proposal is to integrate PayTrie with the NEAR ecosystem and enable on and off-ramping of USDC on NEAR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nPayTrie has successfully been operating in Canada over the past 4 years with the current business model and has on/off-ramped more than $500M in volume. It is clear from the demand that we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing on other stablecoins and networks, that users want an option to get directly on-chain without having to jump through hoops. We are also the only option in Canada that does not custody users\\\\\\\\\\\\' funds. We receive fiat and send out the stablecoins right away. We believe that this is the way that crypto should be bought and sold and we attract users who understand the importance of this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn ecosystem is only as healthy as the on/off ramp solutions. PayTrie will allow Canadians to directly on-ramp onto NEAR and provide net-new liquidity to the network. We believe that launching our on/off ramp for USDC on NEAR would bring a lot of value to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?)\\\\\\\\nThis will not be open source\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nGoal #1: Partnership start - This is when we start the efforts to integrate with the NEAR ecosystem. We will need to take our dev resources to research everything needed to start the integration\\\\\\\\nGoal #2: USDC-NEAR Launch - 4-6 weeks after the initial partnership start, we will officially launch the capability to on and off-ramp USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nVolume - amount of USDC-NEAR that is on/off ramped through PayTrie\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\nPayTrie does not have a direct competitor when it comes to the stablecoin side of the business. Most of the companies in Canada are exchanges and they do not have a focus on stablecoins. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$50,000 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Breakdown of funds usage. How will you use these funds? Be specific.)\\\\\\\\n$40,000 - Development resources - implementing USDC on NEAR will take significant dev resources. We will need to either hire somebody who has knowledge of this or re-prioritize our existing team away from other projects to implement USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n$10,000 - We will be providing each on-ramp transaction with a small amount of $NEAR so that the user can interact with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"paytriejt.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"50000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Onramps / Offramps\"]}"

We provide the quickest, easiest and cheapest way to buy/sell stablecoins. We currently support stablecoins on ERC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BASE, Solana and SX networks. This is the first time that users can buy stablecoins in Canada directly on the network of their choice, without having to jump through hoops/bridging etc. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur proposal is to integrate PayTrie with the NEAR ecosystem and enable on and off-ramping of USDC on NEAR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Why should the committee choose this project?)\\\\\\\\nPayTrie has successfully been operating in Canada over the past 4 years with the current business model and has on/off-ramped more than $500M in volume. It is clear from the demand that we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing on other stablecoins and networks, that users want an option to get directly on-chain without having to jump through hoops. We are also the only option in Canada that does not custody users\\\\\\\\\\\\' funds. We receive fiat and send out the stablecoins right away. We believe that this is the way that crypto should be bought and sold and we attract users who understand the importance of this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn ecosystem is only as healthy as the on/off ramp solutions. PayTrie will allow Canadians to directly on-ramp onto NEAR and provide net-new liquidity to the network. We believe that launching our on/off ramp for USDC on NEAR would bring a lot of value to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Will this solution be open source? What licensing are you releasing under?)\\\\\\\\nThis will not be open source\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\nGoal #1: Partnership start - This is when we start the efforts to integrate with the NEAR ecosystem. We will need to take our dev resources to research everything needed to start the integration\\\\\\\\nGoal #2: USDC-NEAR Launch - 4-6 weeks after the initial partnership start, we will officially launch the capability to on and off-ramp USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\nVolume - amount of USDC-NEAR that is on/off ramped through PayTrie\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\nPayTrie does not have a direct competitor when it comes to the stablecoin side of the business. Most of the companies in Canada are exchanges and they do not have a focus on stablecoins. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n$50,000 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[//]: # (Breakdown of funds usage. How will you use these funds? Be specific.)\\\\\\\\n$40,000 - Development resources - implementing USDC on NEAR will take significant dev resources. We will need to either hire somebody who has knowledge of this or re-prioritize our existing team away from other projects to implement USDC on NEAR. \\\\\\\\n$10,000 - We will be providing each on-ramp transaction with a small amount of $NEAR so that the user can interact with the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"paytriejt.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"50000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"paytriejt.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
