The committee will swiftly address infrastructure concerns with funding and processes to distribute those funds. These processes handle sharing RFPs, submitting proposals, reviewing and voting on proposals, and getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved. This initiative will focus funds on building resilient, fast, redundant infrastructure to meet NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s thriving ecosystem\\\\\\\\\\\\'s short-term and future needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe GitHub Wiki provides information about the [Infrastructure Committee (IC)](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee) and the [Working Group (WG)](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group), including current members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Process Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance, upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline urgent or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals as a response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions are crucial to our collective success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally, the process proceeds as follows;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  The proposal is drafted. Working Group and Committee members are free to review and offer suggestions.\\\\\\\\n2.  Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee members.\\\\\\\\n3.  In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\\\\\\\\n4.  If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline. You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves providing your personal or company information for verification purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is correct.\\\\\\\\n5.  Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on our [Github repo](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group) where the community tracks progress on our [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6). Sharing project status gives the community and ecosystem leaders visibility into the status of awarded projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Important Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following links contain specific information about the processes of responding to RFPs, submitting a proposal, voting, securing funds, and managing the subsequent project for transparency. Please note that the working group will update articles as processes change. We appreciate your patience and understanding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   [RFPs](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Request-For-Proposals)\\\\\\\\n*   [Submitting a Proposal](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Proposal-Process-%E2%80%90-Team)\\\\\\\\n*   [Voting](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Proposal-Process-%E2%80%90-Team#5-voting-on-proposals)\\\\\\\\n*   [Getting Funds](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Funding-Process-%E2%80%90-Company)\\\\\\\\n*   [Managing The Project](https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Projects-&-Tasks)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Areas Of Funding\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Infrastructure Committee is looking for projects in the following areas. These areas are key to the growth and development of the NEAR ecosystem, so we encourage potential proposers to consider them when submitting their proposals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   Wallets\\\\\\\\n*   Oracles\\\\\\\\n*   RPC Nodes\\\\\\\\n*   Bridges\\\\\\\\n*   Onramps / Offramps\\\\\\\\n*   Relayers\\\\\\\\n*   Explorers\\\\\\\\n*   Indexers\\\\\\\\n*   Query API\\\\\\\\n*   Data Lakes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Proposal Markup\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease use the following markdown templates when submitting the body of your proposal.  \\\\\\\\n[Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZRfOE1JAOhsnSmp-RmL2hY7KPJbpBImKZVvPV4YJmA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuggestions are forthcoming.\"}}}}"

The ad network and API plan revamp are in the goal of growing additional revenue, easier developer onboarding and allowing other dApps to leverage nearblocks\\\\\\\\u{2019} audience (1M monthly unique users currently).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Proprietary ad network**. A self-served ad network is being setup with plans ranging from $100 to $300 per month for full exposure across the entire website to leverage 3M monthly impressions and 1M monthly unique visitors.\\\\\\\\n- **Revamp on API plans.** A new pricing model on API plans allowing early founders to leverage historical data starting from $20 per month.\\\\\\\\n- **Aurora integration.** Work on the aurora integration is now ongoing and we will have some results in the coming weeks ; \\\\\\\\n- **DEX Analytics.** In support of the recent \\\\\\\\u{201c}meme\\\\\\\\u{201d} narrative and the potential revival of [Tkn Homes](https://tkn.homes/), we will be adding more analytics on trades, token prices, charts and liquidity pairs and hope to build the same relationship that Pumpfun and Dexscreener have ;\\\\\\\\n- **Migrating from BOS back to React.** With the recent [Pagoda announcement](https://docs.near.org/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset), we will be sunsetting Nearblocks on BOS. It is rather sadening with the change of direction but we do agree with the points surrounding the decision. Building Nearblocks on BOS was a very laborious exercise with a lot of fine tuning and suboptimal user experience. The lack of ability to do npm imports and double loaders we have from first loading BOS and then loaders for data. Our plan will be to keep the lite explorer built on BOS so it can continue to be hosted in a decentralised way without the need for any centralised intermediary. Due to the simplicity of the site, it is a perfect use case for BOS. However, we will transition Nearblocks back to a NextJS app which would allow us to improve the user experience issues we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been facing with BOS (ie. double loaders). Users would see immediate benefits on loading speeds and faster iterations of newer features.\\\\\\\\n- **Existing tasks such as contract stats, verifications.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow in an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #5 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/5).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #1 (month 0-3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Launch of the explorer selector on BOS ([link](https://explorer.near.org/)).\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks is now open-source ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/)).\\\\\\\\n- As well as fixing outdated bugs, re-indexing missing tokens and infrastructure upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #1 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #2 (month 3-6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bulk of the work within these 3 months has been on BOS and our new infrastructure. The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15) ; \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks.

It is rather sadening with the change of direction but we do agree with the points surrounding the decision. Building Nearblocks on BOS was a very laborious exercise with a lot of fine tuning and suboptimal user experience. The lack of ability to do npm imports and double loaders we have from first loading BOS and then loaders for data. Our plan will be to keep the lite explorer built on BOS so it can continue to be hosted in a decentralised way without the need for any centralised intermediary. Due to the simplicity of the site, it is a perfect use case for BOS. However, we will transition Nearblocks back to a NextJS app which would allow us to improve the user experience issues we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been facing with BOS (ie. double loaders). Users would see immediate benefits on loading speeds and faster iterations of newer features.\\\\\\\\n- **Existing tasks such as contract stats, verifications.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow in an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #5 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/5).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #1 (month 0-3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Launch of the explorer selector on BOS ([link](https://explorer.near.org/)).\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks is now open-source ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/)).\\\\\\\\n- As well as fixing outdated bugs, re-indexing missing tokens and infrastructure upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #1 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #2 (month 3-6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bulk of the work within these 3 months has been on BOS and our new infrastructure. The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15) ; \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players ; \\\\\\\\n- Contract connect methods updated to use MNW.

The lack of ability to do npm imports and double loaders we have from first loading BOS and then loaders for data. Our plan will be to keep the lite explorer built on BOS so it can continue to be hosted in a decentralised way without the need for any centralised intermediary. Due to the simplicity of the site, it is a perfect use case for BOS. However, we will transition Nearblocks back to a NextJS app which would allow us to improve the user experience issues we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been facing with BOS (ie. double loaders). Users would see immediate benefits on loading speeds and faster iterations of newer features.\\\\\\\\n- **Existing tasks such as contract stats, verifications.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow in an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #5 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/5).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #1 (month 0-3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Launch of the explorer selector on BOS ([link](https://explorer.near.org/)).\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks is now open-source ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/)).\\\\\\\\n- As well as fixing outdated bugs, re-indexing missing tokens and infrastructure upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #1 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #2 (month 3-6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bulk of the work within these 3 months has been on BOS and our new infrastructure. The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15) ; \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players ; \\\\\\\\n- Contract connect methods updated to use MNW.
