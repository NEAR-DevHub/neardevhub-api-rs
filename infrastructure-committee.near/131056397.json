We may consider switching to read-rpc over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Pricing**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThree types of servers:\\\\\\\\n- RPC (mainnet/testnet): $250 with 2Tb NVME + 1Gbps\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archive Mainnet: $2500 with 90Tb NVME + ~250TB of 10Gpbs traffic\\\\\\\\n- RPC-Archive Testnet: $1000 with ~20Tb NVME + 1Gbps\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal:\\\\\\\\n- 24 RPC nodes: $6000\\\\\\\\n- 4 Mainnet Archival nodes: $10000\\\\\\\\n- 2 Testnet Archival nodes: $2000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Total: $18000 per month**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Load-balancing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur current RPC setup is using a simple DNS-based load balancer. This works well for front-end clients which come from the different IPs. This setup has quite low cost overhead, but it can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used to minimize GEO-spatial latency. There is a latency overhead, because each request might be routed not to the closest server, but instead to a server on a different continent. While it does increase latency by up to ~140ms, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t consider it significant enough to justify costs associated with geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Expected load\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- ~12500 RPS\\\\\\\\n- 32.4B requests per month\\\\\\\\n- 93TB per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost load balancer providers have costs associated with the number of requests. While GCP doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t charge for the number of requests, it has limitations of load balancing across external endpoints and does charge for the traffic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*Note, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have enough experience with GCP load-balancing, so some assumptions might be wrong.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have considered the following options for this proposal:\\\\\\\\n1. Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n3. **PREFERRED** Cloudflare Enterprise geo-spatial load-balancing.\\\\\\\\n4. Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing with proxy instances or GCP LB with simple traffic splitting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #1: Simple DNS-based load-balancing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use a CNAME record for each of the near.org endpoints to point to our endpoints(s).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis option might be fairly simple to setup at **no extra cost**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote, Strict rate-limiting on HTTP referer will require extra work on nodes or an enterprise plan.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #2: Cloudflare Enterprise Load-balancing (CF LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple DNS-based load-balancing can be upgraded to geo-spatial load-balancing at our end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the communication with Cloudflare sales, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve received an estimate for 15B requests per month. Scaling it up to 32.4B requests, the price might be around **~$6000 per month**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCloudflare enterprise offers rate limiting based on HTTP headers, including HTTP Referer or HTTP Origin.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Option #3: Google Cloud Provider Load Balancing (GCP LB)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP external load balancer has bandwidth associated with it. \\\\\\\\nBased on our estimates, the LB traffic is around $10 per TB for ingress, and $10 per TB for egress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGCP LB can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be used for geo-spatial balancing without additional nodes on GCP or other cloud run/functions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo there are 2 options for GCP:\\\\\\\\n- Full load-balancing. Requires RPC egress traffic with proxy nodes. Costs *estimated* **~$16000 per month**\\\\\\\\n- Splitting traffic (no geo-spatial routing). Costs around **~$2000 month**. Need to confirm feasibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Setup (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n    - Setup RPC nodes and Archival RPC nodes\\\\\\\\n    - Setup 4 endpoints to point traffic\\\\\\\\n    - Rate-limiters based on IPs\\\\\\\\n- Status page for new endpoints (2 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Setup external monitoring dashboard (4 weeks)\\\\\\\\n- Setup CF LB (4-8 weeks)\\\\\\\\n    - Negotiate deal with CF for LB\\\\\\\\n    - Setup rate limiter based on the HTTP referer.\\\\\\\\n- Full endpoints migration if necessary (3-6 months)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Requests per second\\\\\\\\n    - All request types (expected to handle steady traffic of 12,500 RPS)\\\\\\\\n    - Function calls (majority of requests)\\\\\\\\n    - TX status\\\\\\\\n    - Broadcast TX\\\\\\\\n- Latency\\\\\\\\n    - Mean latency from 3 geo endpoints (~170ms for view calls)\\\\\\\\n    - P95 latency (~250ms for calls)\\\\\\\\n    - Lower mean/p95 latency after CF LB\\\\\\\\n- Rate limiting (number of throttled calls)\\\\\\\\n- Traffic (expected up to 3Tb per day)\\\\\\\\n- Uptime (expected 99.99%)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Compensation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor maintenance and development we ask for $12,000 a month.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$36,000 per month (paid monthly) for the duration of 6 months.\\\\\\\\n- $18,000 nodes\\\\\\\\n- $6,000 CF LB\\\\\\\\n- $12,000 maintenance \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter 6 months, we expect a significant drop in the usage, so we should re-negotiate a deal based on the new requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"treasury.fastnear.tg\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"216000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": []}"

We will run the `near-indexer-framework` on a dedicated server.\\\\\\\\n2. The dedicated server will host a PostgreSQL database used to temporarily save data before uploading them to Google Cloud.\\\\\\\\n3. Upon receiving a block, we process and save it following the current BigQuery structure.\\\\\\\\n4. Every 500 blocks, we will process the data and upload it to BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage in Avro format. We will use a simple job queue system to manage the status of the work.\\\\\\\\n5. We will retain data locally for up to 7 days only.\\\\\\\\n6. In case the server goes down, we should be able to catch up quickly as long as it hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been 5 epochs.\\\\\\\\n7. We will run a Grafana dashboard that visualizes the current status of the server.\\\\\\\\n8. At the end of the development and during delivery, we expect to get write access to the current BigQuery dataset and Cloud Storage (or ownership transfer).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Advantages and Considerations**:\\\\\\\\n- Our team is more familiar with the near-indexer-framework and monolithic stack.\\\\\\\\n- Given the current block production time and block size, a high-spec server is more than enough to process and upload data to Google Cloud.\\\\\\\\n- It is considerably cheaper to use this stack compared to maintaining a Databricks pipeline\\\\\\\\n- It costs around **$250** per month to maintain a server versus **$3,000\\\\\\\\u{2013}$5,000 or more** per month on a full fledge data pipeline.\\\\\\\\n- We capture data more quickly directly from the NEAR core.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Drawbacks and Limitations:**\\\\\\\\n- We are limited to the dedicated server provider\\\\\\\\\\\\'s promised uptime (99.9%).\\\\\\\\n- There are more risks and work involved in maintaining our own infrastructure, such as keeping software dependencies updated.\\\\\\\\n- Scaling up could be harder and might incur downtime. This can easily be mitigated by using a higher-spec server unless the workload exceeds the server\\\\\\\\\\\\'s capacity.\\\\\\\\n- Although this should not happen, during a disaster scenario where the server goes down for more than 2.5 days (5 epochs) and NEAR Core can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t provide us with block data anymore, we will have to devise an alternative plan to recover data for that period.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Documentation and support**\\\\\\\\n- The new repository will be open-source.\\\\\\\\n- We will prepare documentation on how to set up and run another instance of the indexer to maintain the data pipeline.\\\\\\\\n- We will create a Telegram group and add all stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n- For issue support, responses will be provided within 24 hours during workdays and within 48 hours during non-workdays.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Costs:**\\\\\\\\n- Indexer Server\\\\\\\\n    - 16 cores / 32 threads @ 4GHz\\\\\\\\n    - 128 GB DDR5 RAM\\\\\\\\n    - 3 \\\\\\\\u{d7} 1.92 TB NVMe SSDs\\\\\\\\n    - Approximately **$250 USD** per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Google Cloud Infrastructures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Only if ownership transfer occurs: Assuming we will be taking over ownership of both Google Cloud BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage objects. These costs are based on the Google Cloud cost calculator and the information we have; please point out if it is inaccurate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - BigQuery\\\\\\\\n        - Region: us-east1\\\\\\\\n        - Maximum slots: 100 (small)\\\\\\\\n        - 100 TB storage (current size is 40 TB plus 12 months \\\\\\\\u{d7} 4 TB per month, with margin)\\\\\\\\n        - Approximately **$5,850 USD** per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - Cloud Storage\\\\\\\\n        - Region: us-east1\\\\\\\\n        - Standard Storage\\\\\\\\n        - 100 TB storage (current size is 40 TB plus 12 months \\\\\\\\u{d7} 4 TB per month, with margin)\\\\\\\\n        - Approximately **$2,050 USD** per month\\\\\\\\n        - Upon further understanding the use cases of the Avro pipeline, we can better decide if we want to move some infrequently accessed historical data to a different storage class to further cut costs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Team\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- 1 senior engineer and 1 intermediate engineer for redundancy (backup and support as needed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- **$10,000 USD** per month\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Extra Margin\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- This amount will only be requested in case unexpected issues arise that are outside the project scope\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- **$50,000 USD**\\\\\\\\n- **Total budget for 12 months:**\\\\\\\\n    - **$3,000 USD** for the indexer server\\\\\\\\n    - **$94,800 USD** for google cloud infrastructure\\\\\\\\n    - **$120,000 USD** for the team\\\\\\\\n    - **$50,000 USD** contingency\\\\\\\\n    - **$267,800 USD** in total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Milestones**\\\\\\\\n- Milestone 1: 6 weeks for building the pipeline\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Setting up the indexer and database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Converting the current Python scripts into Rust code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Deliverables: A BigQuery dataset and Google Cloud Storage that are publicly viewable, following the requirements of the RFP, with initial inaccuracies expected.\\\\\\\\n- Milestone 2: 4 weeks for data auditing and quality checks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- We will build a Grafana dashboard (similar to [near lake grafana dashboard](https://nearinc.grafana.net/public-dashboards/773648953bdc423eb5eb6324b89238d8)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Deliverables: Accurate BigQuery dataset and Google Cloud Storage, with high accuracy compared to current data, and a Grafana dashboard.\\\\\\\\n- Milestone 3: 4 weeks for documentation and integration with at least one partner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- This timeline depends on the requirements of our partners, as we will have only the latest data available at this point, not the full historical data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- This period also involves running two systems in parallel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Deliverables: An integrated system with a partner, and an open-source repository with a simple README.\\\\\\\\n- Maintenance Phase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- The remaining time will be dedicated to maintaining the services, updating according to NEP updates, and providing issue support, with no further feature development planned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Payment Schedule:**\\\\\\\\n- Initial Payment: $25,000 USD upon project commencement.\\\\\\\\n- Milestone Payments:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Upon Milestone 1 Completion: $15,000 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Upon Milestone 2 Completion: $15,000 USD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Upon Milestone 3 Completion: $15,000 USD\\\\\\\\n- Remaining Payments:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- Depending on whether the transfer of ownership of Google Cloud BigQuery and Storage occurs, the remaining balance will be paid in three equal installments in April, June, and August.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t- In Case of Ownership Transfer: $65,930 USD per installment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t- If No Ownership Transfer: $17,670 USD per installment.\\\\\\\\n- Contingency Fund:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- The $50,000 USD contingency will only be requested if unforeseen issues arise outside the project scope.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Team Background**\\\\\\\\nThe Meteor Wallet team brings extensive experience with the NEAR Protocol. We are currently developing Meteor Wallet and maintaining MyNearWallet, both of which are integral parts of the NEAR ecosystem.
