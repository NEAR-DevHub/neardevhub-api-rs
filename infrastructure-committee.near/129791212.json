Our indexers and APIs have been open-source from the beginning, but the APIs are not production-ready yet. This proposal focuses on polishing the APIs to enable developers to gather on-chain events more easily, without a heavy backend and writing their own indexers, and improving Tearbot, our free bot with notifications, that will soon have block explorer capabilities.\", \"category\": \"Infrastructure Committee\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"DRAFT\"}, \"description\": \"## Organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIntear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Primary person\\\\\\\\u{2019}s contact information\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVolodymyr Malanchuk, slime@intear.tech, https://t.me/slimytentacles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Size of the whole team\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Size of the engineering team\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2 (but only 1 will be working on the projects mentioned in this proposal)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Team location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemote\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Team background and bios\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe started as a memecoin, but after looking at similar projects on other chains, we realized that there is a gap in memecoin tooling - no free telegram bot that sends notifications in a group when someone buys a token, so we built a bot and that has its own indexer. Then found another gap - a tip bot that can send arbitrary tokens, not just near, and is easy to connect, and have been adding more functionality ever since. During TPS spikes caused by HOT Wallet events, the bot stopped working, as well as, dexscreener, near.org RPCs, and some of the other indexers, so we decided to rewrite the bot from scratch with performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in mind, and eventually decided to create public APIs for anyone to use the infrastructure that powers our new bot.

Github: https://github.com/Sliman4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in some way connected to a big chunk of the ecosystem, but our closest partnership is with Shitzu. A modified version of our tip bot is used in Shitzu Boost, one of the biggest marketing initiatives used by NEAR ecosystem, our bot had meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual tokens\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" support on the same time as meme.cooking launched, and we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re actively discussing building new things together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot really affiliations, but I think it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth mentioning that we have the most popular and our telegram bot is used by almost all NEAR projects, particularly memecoins but also a lot of development chats like NEAR Dev, and general-audience chats like NEAR Protocol Official, Meteor Russian, and many more. Regarding unrelated to infra, we used to participate in Ref Finance\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Meme Season event and Shitzu\\\\\\\\\\\\'s memecoin index until recently (we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to freeze our token soon), are participating in TextRoyale tournament (game that uses Bitte Wallet in telegram), joining development initiatives such as building a [Bitte Agent](https://wallet.bitte.ai/smart-actions/prompt/how%20can%20you%20assist%20me%3F?mode=debug&agentId=tokens-agent.intear.tech) that fetches price data from prices.intear.tech, [MoreTPS leaderboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) that uses a custom indexer and Intear APIs, and have many unannounced collabs with tech projects in the ecosystem, and among the most recent ones, will probably help the ecosystem [be a safer place](https://t.me/neardev/57416).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near worked as a freelancer for ~7 years, mostly making Minecraft plugins, sometimes tried starting own projects. One of the crypto-related projects was [WalletConnectMC](https://github.com/CraftToken/WalletConnectMC) which provided a decentralized and frictionless connection, and optional wallet-less onboarding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/INTEARnear/ has a lot of repos with NEAR code:\\\\\\\\n- [`inevents`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inevents/) is our API framework that is not stable yet, but public API documentation is available at [Intear Docs](https://docs.intear.tech). It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a framework that can be easily extended with other types of events and be self-hosted. In short, it takes an event schema, event stream from Redis (emitted by some indexer), saves it in a database, and provides HTTP / WebSocket APIs to access historical and realtime data\\\\\\\\n- [`inindexer`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) - framework for building indexers that handles all boilerplate for you (ctrl-c handlers, continue-on-interrupt, combine receipts into transactions, etc.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are our products built on top of these 2:\\\\\\\\n- [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) contains open source code of t.me/bettearbot, a bot that has notifications about certain transactions, Near.social / BOS / DAO notifications, near-cli-rs in Telegram, and much more, [partially open source](https://github.com/INTEARnear/Tear)\\\\\\\\n- [TPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/) - lightweight TPS tracker that uses `inevents` API as data source, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-dashboard)\\\\\\\\n- [Trades demo](https://trades-demo.intear.tech/?account=aldor.near) shows historical trades and adds new trades in realtime, using `inevents` API, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/trades-demo)\\\\\\\\n- [NFT demo](https://nft-demo.intear.tech/) is a fork of https://nft.near.stream/ that uses `inevents`, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-mints)\\\\\\\\n- [Oracle marketplace](https://github.com/INTEARnear/oracle) that uses yielded execution + `inindexer` to listen for requests. Can potentially do IPFS upload / download, zkfetch with Reclaim Protocol, AI inference, get data from other chains for chain abstraction, and many other. Currently, not maintained, but we have plans to continue its development in October-November.\\\\\\\\n- [Redacted explorer](https://explorer.intear.tech/token/wrap.near) - a WIP block explorer built on top of our APIs, [github](https://github.com/redacted-explorer/redacted-explorer-frontend).\\\\\\\\n- [Charts](https://codepen.io/Sliman4/pen/jOgOgpz) - TradingView charts that get information about tokens from Intear token APIs (token search + OHLC).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s personal examples of experience:\\\\\\\\n- [RPC Selector](https://github.com/Sliman4/rpc-selector) browser extension that redirects all RPC requests to a custom one\\\\\\\\n- [Abstraction is inevitable](https://medium.com/@slimedragon/chain-abstraction-8d7dbd110d09) (article that was published before there were docs on docs.near.org)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign, BD, Project Management, User Support, Frontend, Backend, QA.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal includes this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Open-source indexers in https://github.com/INTEARnear/, are almost done, but they need to be maintained and some minor features have to be added / fixed:\\\\\\\\n   - NFT transfer / mint / burn: https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-indexer. Needs a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"trade\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" event for trades on Mintbase, Paras, TradePort, MITTE. There are solutions that index NFT trades, but they don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work with non-standard custodial exchanges like MITTE, which generates the most NFT volume. This will be done when / if MITTE gets out of beta.\\\\\\\\n   - Potlock project / pot donation indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/potlock-indexer. Would be nice to support potlock\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" feature for custom project registries, but the official frontend doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t allow creating lists, and no one is using them, so this is not included in this proposal.\\\\\\\\n   - Trade indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/trade-indexer. Has different events for fetching events as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"balance changes after tx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"one pool at a time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pool change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (triggered on swaps, liquidity add / remove, anything that triggers state change). Currently supports Ref Finance, ref.hot.tg, Dragonbot, meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"staking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, and we were planning to support other DEXes, but it seems they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not as active, so for now, this indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need any changes.\\\\\\\\n   - New token deployment indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/new-token-indexer. It supports all NEP-141 tokens (tkn.near, tknx.near, token0.near, and custom contracts), as well as meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, but it has to be extended with an ability to detect new NFT contracts.\\\\\\\\n   - SocialDB indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/socialdb-indexer. Supports notifications, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t support posts, replies, and other non-`index` fields, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to, since near social has their own indexer.\\\\\\\\n   - TPS indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-indexer. Basic information about every block, such as transaction / receipt count, producer, block time. An API with pagination could be more useful than fetching every block from RPC one by one. This indexer is fully done and doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need changes.\\\\\\\\n   - Price indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/price-indexer. Calculates prices of different tokens so that realtime or historical information about prices can be retrieved. Providers [Ref](https://indexer.ref.finance/list-token-price)-[compatible](https://prices.intear.tech/list-token-price) interface for fetching prices. It has auto-discovery of new tokens thanks to new token indexer mentioned above, starting to track their prices immediately, and has a [spam list](https://prices.intear.tech/token-spam-list) that is moderated by AI every time a new token comes out (can be useful to wallets and permissionless dapps), [token search](https://prices.intear.tech/token-search?q=intear) with intelligent ranking based on project reputation, full / partial query match, market capitalization, and other factors. It needs to also include the token liquidity into the ranking calculation, add daily / weekly / monthly / total volume, and a lot more small features. Also needs to have an ability to backfill data.\\\\\\\\n   - FT indexer: Mint, burn, transfer events, that can be filtered by sender / receiver. Fully implemented.\\\\\\\\n   - Transaction indexer: Contains basic information about transactions and receipts, just enough to be able to build a blockchain explorer. Needs a few iterations to see what people want to filter by, but mostly done.\\\\\\\\n   - Liquidity indexer: LP add / remove / lock / unlock events, top liquidity holders. Add / remove events are implemented, but locks are not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Aurora transactions, Aurora Cloud appchain transactions, chain signatures, maybe HOT MPC events (TBD, based on demand). Not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Log indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/log-indexer. Supports text logs and NEP-297 events, but these types of events are not stored and can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be accessed using our historical event API due to the volume of logs. This will be fixed if we can afford more storage, and for now we just have the same thing as `near.stream`. It would be a powerful tool that may remove the need for indexers in some apps. For example, some users in our Telegram chat were complaining about Burrow not showing liquidation logs, so we added notifications using realtime logs API. If we could retrieve filtered history of logs for a specific contract + specific event (e.g. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"liquidate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), that could remove the need for custom dapp indexers entirely. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to make a standard that allows indexing / filtering inside events, not just by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" / \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", that will make some smart contract developers almost never write custom indexers - https://t.me/neardev/57114. The feedback seems to be positive, but we need to figure out a way to scale it, or make it a paid service.\\\\\\\\n   - Some of the above have a testnet counterpart, but some don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t. Where applicable, all events should have a testnet version of the event.\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inindexer` crate.\\\\\\\\n2. HTTP / WebSocket APIs are [already live](https://docs.intear.tech), they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re [somewhat reliable](https://status.intear.tech/), but need some work to become production-ready:\\\\\\\\n   - Implement better DDoS protection, rate limiting, improve database performance (the current queries were made as a fast prototype and half of them are not used by anyone in production).\\\\\\\\n   - Get better hardware. We estimate that we will need about 20 Tb of storage to sync with mainnet and have enough until the beginning of 2025, with a projection of 5% monthly growth.\\\\\\\\n   - Get more user feedback to make the APIs easier to use, especially when it comes to getting both historical and realtime data together.\\\\\\\\n   - Synchronize with mainnet from genesis block to include the full history of events.\\\\\\\\n   - Upload weekly or daily database dumps so that everyone can extract any data they want.\\\\\\\\n   - Auto-generated Typescript library for accessing these APIs (same way as we auto-generate [swagger ui](https://events.intear.tech/query/swagger-ui/)).\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inevents` crate.\\\\\\\\n   - Service credits equal to the amount of this proposal, that can be spent on private API servers or any other services that are listed in the body of this proposal.\\\\\\\\n3. [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) Telegram bot:\\\\\\\\n   - Support of all above mentioned events (where applicable), so that users can receive notifications about all kinds of transactions with flexible and user-friendly filtering options.\\\\\\\\n   - `/price`, `/chart` command so that people can see TradingView token charts in Telegram. Currently, the closest alternative that exists in our bot is `/token`.\\\\\\\\n   - History of account transactions, token swaps, and other events (basically a mini block explorer in Telegram that covers most popular use cases)\\\\\\\\n   - Realtime tracking of all actions of a wallet (outgoing tx, incoming tx, incoming FT / NFT, etc.)\\\\\\\\n   - All features included in this proposal will be open-source, and existing private features will gradually become open-source once we reach certain milestones (TBD) of total users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal is to:\\\\\\\\n- Have all the indexers mentioned above done in 1 month after this proposal is approved\\\\\\\\n- Have an improved HTTP / WebSocket API live in 2 months, with at least 99% uptime the first month after the upgrade.\\\\\\\\n- Make all APIs and libraries production-ready and stable in 3 months.\\\\\\\\n- Release Tearbot features as soon as they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done, but no later than in 2 months\\\\\\\\n- Have everything above documented on docs.intear.tech, with video tutorials where they would be useful\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the metrics that will be tracked:\\\\\\\\n- Projects using `inindexer` (I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m aware of 2 private codebases that use it on mainnet now, and a few people reached out to me asking about it, but not sure about the current status)\\\\\\\\n- Dapps and wallets using HTTP / WebSocket APIs (currently 1 known and a few more unidentified ones)\\\\\\\\n- Historical API requests per month (currently it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s around 2,000,000)\\\\\\\\n- Users of our Telegram bots (currently about 3,000 total, and hard to tell how many are active because people can just set up the bot once and receive notifications without reconfiguring it ever since)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks API has more detailed historical data, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have high-level \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-like APIs. Also, judging by my own, and other telegram bot developers\\\\\\\\\\\\' experience, Nearblocks API has had consistently less-than-ideal uptime, to the point that Dragon Tech bot had to stop using it in favor of Pikespeak, then switched back for some unknown reason, and in one of the most important moments for the NEAR degen ecosystem, the launch of $CHILL last week, Nearblocks went down for 12 hours straight, and $CHILL closed their telegram chat until the bot starts working. It was resolved by setting up our bot, which had no problems with real-time APIs at that time.\\\\\\\\n- Pikespeak API has high-level event data for some events, as well as detailed historical data, but lacks realtime APIs, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have all events that Intear has, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not as easy to add new ones or self-host the API, since it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not open-source. For instance, building TPS Indexer + a custom event for [MoreTPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) + and deploying HTTP + WebSocket APIs for these events took less than 1h30m (not including the frontend, which took an additional hour of prompting websim and editing).\\\\\\\\n- `indexer.ref.finance` provides token price data, but only for whitelisted tokens, and has rate limits, while our indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any limits because we cache our responses for a few seconds instead of fetching data from blockchain every time. Not the most precise way, but totally acceptable for 99.99% of use cases.\\\\\\\\n- `wss://events.near.stream/ws` provides realtime logs from contracts using WebSocket. Our APIs provide more high-level access to on-chain events that can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be extracted from logs, such as FT price changes, with custom filters for each. We provide access to arbitrary logs as well, with server-side filtering with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"starts with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ends with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"contains\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact match\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, as well as NEP-297 parsed logs with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_semver_compatible\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, to avoid sending all logs to every user. `events.near.stream` also has server-side filtering, not sure how flexible they are, but I\\\\\\\\\\\\'d say we do the same thing, and there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not much difference which one to choose, unless you want to extract many historical events, in which case we provide HTTP API.\\\\\\\\n- Almost every project maintains their own list of whitelisted and blacklisted (spam) tokens. We have an actively maintained list with free unlimited API usage, automatic spam token flagging using AI, ease of adding a new token through a telegram bot, and various \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of reputation - Spam, Unknown, NotFake, Reputable.\\\\\\\\n- indexer.xyz and Mintbase provide NFT data, they have much more data than Intear because they specialize in NFTs, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not trying to compete with them.\\\\\\\\n- FastNear provides indexers for staking and tokens, but our APIs don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t intersect. In fact, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using FastNear for some of the features in our telegram bot Tearbot.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Bot: It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a trading bot, while our bot is mainly informational, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not competing. By the way, we participated in their trading competition as a memecoin in March.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Tech: It has one feature that is the same as our bot (buy notifications), but our bot has more customizations. As for the other features, the Dragon Tech developer and me have unofficially decided to move in different directions, Dragon Tech will focus on safety (captcha, portal, moderation) while our bot will have blockchain-related features.\\\\\\\\n- LNC Watcher Bot: It has only 1 simple feature (logging transactions done to a contract), we have a similar feature (logging logs / events emitted by a contract), but I wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t call that competition.\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Lake, FastNear neardata: they are data sources, not indexers.\\\\\\\\n- QueryAPI: Also allows indexing blockchain events, but has some disadvantages: 1) Rust is faster and more reliable than javascript (not even typescript), which matters quite a lot when you process 5000 receipts per second, 2) the environment is quite limited, you can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have heavy state without pulling it from database every block, access external resources, 3) sometimes you may want to self-host to save money (and from what I\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve heard, QueryAPI is definitely not the cheapest service to maintain), to process the whole database locally, use external packages (not sure if it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible with QueryAPI), or choose a database that is most efficient for specific types of queries, which is quite important for databases with millions / billions of events. All of these disadvantages are also advantages for certain use cases. Some simple use cases might not even need to have their own indexer and just use our historical log event API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Current Market Size\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight now, most dapps don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any realtime functionality or indexers. But the UX of pretty much every dapp can be significantly improved if you add realtime updates or transaction history, so almost every dapp is a potential user of our APIs. The biggest dapps (Ref, Burrow) do have their own indexers, but these dapps took years of development and have enough resources to dedicate to this, while new startups struggle to even make an MVP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for the Telegram bot, it already has features that can be of interest to any type of NEAR user: traders, investors, builders, degens, DAOs, and adding a mini block explorer, as well as more events that can be tracked, will increase the market even more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `inindexer`: Used by meme.cooking and a few other projects that are not yet on mainnet (or I don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know project names, just received some DMs from people asking about it).\\\\\\\\n- `inevents`: Used only by us, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not yet ready for public use and not published on crates.io.\\\\\\\\n- APIs: Recently, we started offering private API service, and our [first](https://x.com/Dragon_Tech_Bot/status/1836125531596619869) user is [Dragon Tech](https://t.me/Dragon_Tech_Bot).\\\\\\\\n- Tearbot: Used by traders, investors, and degens. The brightest example that is publicly available is probably [DoubleDog launch](https://t.me/intearchat/2485) where our users dominated the market because they had a tool. (the message was posted by me, but by that time, 2 users have already bought). There are lots of these tools on other chains, lack of them on NEAR makes a huge difference in trading / degen / investing experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$18,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopment: $12,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware: $6,000:\\\\\\\\n- One-time set up cost of a bare metal server with 4x 8Tb SSDs: $5,000. Not many service providers offer 20+ Tb of SSD storage on a single instance, so our choice is quite limited. The CPU / RAM requirements for our services are very low (we used to run on a $32/mo VPS until recently), and the SSD storage is not going to have frequent rewrites, so the options we have from cloud service providers are an overkill for our use case (for 20Tb, Hetzner - $1200/mo, AWS cheapest aurora - $2000/mo, AWS cheapest gp3 - $1600/mo, not including egress), so investing in a bare metal server is a better choice that will return the investment in a couple of months.\\\\\\\\n- Storage for snapshots and server runtime: $1,000. We acknowledge that during the early stages of adoption, there probably won\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be a huge mission-critical demand for downloading our database snapshots, and they will be chunked by event type (most event types weight less than 1% of the total database size), so there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no need to spend too much on fast download speeds until it becomes a problem that needs a solution.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"slimedragon.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"18000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Indexers\", \"Explorers\"]}"

Then found another gap - a tip bot that can send arbitrary tokens, not just near, and is easy to connect, and have been adding more functionality ever since. During TPS spikes caused by HOT Wallet events, the bot stopped working, as well as, dexscreener, near.org RPCs, and some of the other indexers, so we decided to rewrite the bot from scratch with performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in mind, and eventually decided to create public APIs for anyone to use the infrastructure that powers our new bot.

Regarding unrelated to infra, we used to participate in Ref Finance\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Meme Season event and Shitzu\\\\\\\\\\\\'s memecoin index until recently (we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to freeze our token soon), are participating in TextRoyale tournament (game that uses Bitte Wallet in telegram), joining development initiatives such as building a [Bitte Agent](https://wallet.bitte.ai/smart-actions/prompt/how%20can%20you%20assist%20me%3F?mode=debug&agentId=tokens-agent.intear.tech) that fetches price data from prices.intear.tech, [MoreTPS leaderboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) that uses a custom indexer and Intear APIs, and have many unannounced collabs with tech projects in the ecosystem, and among the most recent ones, will probably help the ecosystem [be a safer place](https://t.me/neardev/57416).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near worked as a freelancer for ~7 years, mostly making Minecraft plugins, sometimes tried starting own projects. One of the crypto-related projects was [WalletConnectMC](https://github.com/CraftToken/WalletConnectMC) which provided a decentralized and frictionless connection, and optional wallet-less onboarding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/INTEARnear/ has a lot of repos with NEAR code:\\\\\\\\n- [`inevents`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inevents/) is our API framework that is not stable yet, but public API documentation is available at [Intear Docs](https://docs.intear.tech). It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a framework that can be easily extended with other types of events and be self-hosted. In short, it takes an event schema, event stream from Redis (emitted by some indexer), saves it in a database, and provides HTTP / WebSocket APIs to access historical and realtime data\\\\\\\\n- [`inindexer`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) - framework for building indexers that handles all boilerplate for you (ctrl-c handlers, continue-on-interrupt, combine receipts into transactions, etc.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are our products built on top of these 2:\\\\\\\\n- [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) contains open source code of t.me/bettearbot, a bot that has notifications about certain transactions, Near.social / BOS / DAO notifications, near-cli-rs in Telegram, and much more, [partially open source](https://github.com/INTEARnear/Tear)\\\\\\\\n- [TPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/) - lightweight TPS tracker that uses `inevents` API as data source, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-dashboard)\\\\\\\\n- [Trades demo](https://trades-demo.intear.tech/?account=aldor.near) shows historical trades and adds new trades in realtime, using `inevents` API, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/trades-demo)\\\\\\\\n- [NFT demo](https://nft-demo.intear.tech/) is a fork of https://nft.near.stream/ that uses `inevents`, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-mints)\\\\\\\\n- [Oracle marketplace](https://github.com/INTEARnear/oracle) that uses yielded execution + `inindexer` to listen for requests. Can potentially do IPFS upload / download, zkfetch with Reclaim Protocol, AI inference, get data from other chains for chain abstraction, and many other. Currently, not maintained, but we have plans to continue its development in October-November.\\\\\\\\n- [Redacted explorer](https://explorer.intear.tech/token/wrap.near) - a WIP block explorer built on top of our APIs, [github](https://github.com/redacted-explorer/redacted-explorer-frontend).\\\\\\\\n- [Charts](https://codepen.io/Sliman4/pen/jOgOgpz) - TradingView charts that get information about tokens from Intear token APIs (token search + OHLC).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s personal examples of experience:\\\\\\\\n- [RPC Selector](https://github.com/Sliman4/rpc-selector) browser extension that redirects all RPC requests to a custom one\\\\\\\\n- [Abstraction is inevitable](https://medium.com/@slimedragon/chain-abstraction-8d7dbd110d09) (article that was published before there were docs on docs.near.org)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign, BD, Project Management, User Support, Frontend, Backend, QA.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal includes this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Open-source indexers in https://github.com/INTEARnear/, are almost done, but they need to be maintained and some minor features have to be added / fixed:\\\\\\\\n   - NFT transfer / mint / burn: https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-indexer. Needs a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"trade\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" event for trades on Mintbase, Paras, TradePort, MITTE. There are solutions that index NFT trades, but they don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work with non-standard custodial exchanges like MITTE, which generates the most NFT volume. This will be done when / if MITTE gets out of beta.\\\\\\\\n   - Potlock project / pot donation indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/potlock-indexer. Would be nice to support potlock\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" feature for custom project registries, but the official frontend doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t allow creating lists, and no one is using them, so this is not included in this proposal.\\\\\\\\n   - Trade indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/trade-indexer. Has different events for fetching events as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"balance changes after tx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"one pool at a time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pool change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (triggered on swaps, liquidity add / remove, anything that triggers state change). Currently supports Ref Finance, ref.hot.tg, Dragonbot, meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"staking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, and we were planning to support other DEXes, but it seems they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not as active, so for now, this indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need any changes.\\\\\\\\n   - New token deployment indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/new-token-indexer. It supports all NEP-141 tokens (tkn.near, tknx.near, token0.near, and custom contracts), as well as meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, but it has to be extended with an ability to detect new NFT contracts.\\\\\\\\n   - SocialDB indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/socialdb-indexer. Supports notifications, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t support posts, replies, and other non-`index` fields, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to, since near social has their own indexer.\\\\\\\\n   - TPS indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-indexer. Basic information about every block, such as transaction / receipt count, producer, block time. An API with pagination could be more useful than fetching every block from RPC one by one. This indexer is fully done and doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need changes.\\\\\\\\n   - Price indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/price-indexer. Calculates prices of different tokens so that realtime or historical information about prices can be retrieved. Providers [Ref](https://indexer.ref.finance/list-token-price)-[compatible](https://prices.intear.tech/list-token-price) interface for fetching prices. It has auto-discovery of new tokens thanks to new token indexer mentioned above, starting to track their prices immediately, and has a [spam list](https://prices.intear.tech/token-spam-list) that is moderated by AI every time a new token comes out (can be useful to wallets and permissionless dapps), [token search](https://prices.intear.tech/token-search?q=intear) with intelligent ranking based on project reputation, full / partial query match, market capitalization, and other factors. It needs to also include the token liquidity into the ranking calculation, add daily / weekly / monthly / total volume, and a lot more small features. Also needs to have an ability to backfill data.\\\\\\\\n   - FT indexer: Mint, burn, transfer events, that can be filtered by sender / receiver. Fully implemented.\\\\\\\\n   - Transaction indexer: Contains basic information about transactions and receipts, just enough to be able to build a blockchain explorer. Needs a few iterations to see what people want to filter by, but mostly done.\\\\\\\\n   - Liquidity indexer: LP add / remove / lock / unlock events, top liquidity holders. Add / remove events are implemented, but locks are not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Aurora transactions, Aurora Cloud appchain transactions, chain signatures, maybe HOT MPC events (TBD, based on demand). Not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Log indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/log-indexer. Supports text logs and NEP-297 events, but these types of events are not stored and can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be accessed using our historical event API due to the volume of logs. This will be fixed if we can afford more storage, and for now we just have the same thing as `near.stream`. It would be a powerful tool that may remove the need for indexers in some apps. For example, some users in our Telegram chat were complaining about Burrow not showing liquidation logs, so we added notifications using realtime logs API. If we could retrieve filtered history of logs for a specific contract + specific event (e.g. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"liquidate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), that could remove the need for custom dapp indexers entirely. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to make a standard that allows indexing / filtering inside events, not just by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" / \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", that will make some smart contract developers almost never write custom indexers - https://t.me/neardev/57114. The feedback seems to be positive, but we need to figure out a way to scale it, or make it a paid service.\\\\\\\\n   - Some of the above have a testnet counterpart, but some don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t. Where applicable, all events should have a testnet version of the event.\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inindexer` crate.\\\\\\\\n2. HTTP / WebSocket APIs are [already live](https://docs.intear.tech), they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re [somewhat reliable](https://status.intear.tech/), but need some work to become production-ready:\\\\\\\\n   - Implement better DDoS protection, rate limiting, improve database performance (the current queries were made as a fast prototype and half of them are not used by anyone in production).\\\\\\\\n   - Get better hardware. We estimate that we will need about 20 Tb of storage to sync with mainnet and have enough until the beginning of 2025, with a projection of 5% monthly growth.\\\\\\\\n   - Get more user feedback to make the APIs easier to use, especially when it comes to getting both historical and realtime data together.\\\\\\\\n   - Synchronize with mainnet from genesis block to include the full history of events.\\\\\\\\n   - Upload weekly or daily database dumps so that everyone can extract any data they want.\\\\\\\\n   - Auto-generated Typescript library for accessing these APIs (same way as we auto-generate [swagger ui](https://events.intear.tech/query/swagger-ui/)).\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inevents` crate.\\\\\\\\n   - Service credits equal to the amount of this proposal, that can be spent on private API servers or any other services that are listed in the body of this proposal.\\\\\\\\n3. [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) Telegram bot:\\\\\\\\n   - Support of all above mentioned events (where applicable), so that users can receive notifications about all kinds of transactions with flexible and user-friendly filtering options.\\\\\\\\n   - `/price`, `/chart` command so that people can see TradingView token charts in Telegram. Currently, the closest alternative that exists in our bot is `/token`.\\\\\\\\n   - History of account transactions, token swaps, and other events (basically a mini block explorer in Telegram that covers most popular use cases)\\\\\\\\n   - Realtime tracking of all actions of a wallet (outgoing tx, incoming tx, incoming FT / NFT, etc.)\\\\\\\\n   - All features included in this proposal will be open-source, and existing private features will gradually become open-source once we reach certain milestones (TBD) of total users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal is to:\\\\\\\\n- Have all the indexers mentioned above done in 1 month after this proposal is approved\\\\\\\\n- Have an improved HTTP / WebSocket API live in 2 months, with at least 99% uptime the first month after the upgrade.\\\\\\\\n- Make all APIs and libraries production-ready and stable in 3 months.\\\\\\\\n- Release Tearbot features as soon as they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done, but no later than in 2 months\\\\\\\\n- Have everything above documented on docs.intear.tech, with video tutorials where they would be useful\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the metrics that will be tracked:\\\\\\\\n- Projects using `inindexer` (I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m aware of 2 private codebases that use it on mainnet now, and a few people reached out to me asking about it, but not sure about the current status)\\\\\\\\n- Dapps and wallets using HTTP / WebSocket APIs (currently 1 known and a few more unidentified ones)\\\\\\\\n- Historical API requests per month (currently it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s around 2,000,000)\\\\\\\\n- Users of our Telegram bots (currently about 3,000 total, and hard to tell how many are active because people can just set up the bot once and receive notifications without reconfiguring it ever since)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks API has more detailed historical data, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have high-level \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-like APIs. Also, judging by my own, and other telegram bot developers\\\\\\\\\\\\' experience, Nearblocks API has had consistently less-than-ideal uptime, to the point that Dragon Tech bot had to stop using it in favor of Pikespeak, then switched back for some unknown reason, and in one of the most important moments for the NEAR degen ecosystem, the launch of $CHILL last week, Nearblocks went down for 12 hours straight, and $CHILL closed their telegram chat until the bot starts working. It was resolved by setting up our bot, which had no problems with real-time APIs at that time.\\\\\\\\n- Pikespeak API has high-level event data for some events, as well as detailed historical data, but lacks realtime APIs, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have all events that Intear has, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not as easy to add new ones or self-host the API, since it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not open-source. For instance, building TPS Indexer + a custom event for [MoreTPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) + and deploying HTTP + WebSocket APIs for these events took less than 1h30m (not including the frontend, which took an additional hour of prompting websim and editing).\\\\\\\\n- `indexer.ref.finance` provides token price data, but only for whitelisted tokens, and has rate limits, while our indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any limits because we cache our responses for a few seconds instead of fetching data from blockchain every time. Not the most precise way, but totally acceptable for 99.99% of use cases.\\\\\\\\n- `wss://events.near.stream/ws` provides realtime logs from contracts using WebSocket. Our APIs provide more high-level access to on-chain events that can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be extracted from logs, such as FT price changes, with custom filters for each. We provide access to arbitrary logs as well, with server-side filtering with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"starts with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ends with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"contains\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact match\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, as well as NEP-297 parsed logs with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_semver_compatible\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, to avoid sending all logs to every user. `events.near.stream` also has server-side filtering, not sure how flexible they are, but I\\\\\\\\\\\\'d say we do the same thing, and there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not much difference which one to choose, unless you want to extract many historical events, in which case we provide HTTP API.\\\\\\\\n- Almost every project maintains their own list of whitelisted and blacklisted (spam) tokens. We have an actively maintained list with free unlimited API usage, automatic spam token flagging using AI, ease of adding a new token through a telegram bot, and various \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of reputation - Spam, Unknown, NotFake, Reputable.\\\\\\\\n- indexer.xyz and Mintbase provide NFT data, they have much more data than Intear because they specialize in NFTs, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not trying to compete with them.\\\\\\\\n- FastNear provides indexers for staking and tokens, but our APIs don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t intersect. In fact, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using FastNear for some of the features in our telegram bot Tearbot.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Bot: It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a trading bot, while our bot is mainly informational, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not competing. By the way, we participated in their trading competition as a memecoin in March.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Tech: It has one feature that is the same as our bot (buy notifications), but our bot has more customizations. As for the other features, the Dragon Tech developer and me have unofficially decided to move in different directions, Dragon Tech will focus on safety (captcha, portal, moderation) while our bot will have blockchain-related features.\\\\\\\\n- LNC Watcher Bot: It has only 1 simple feature (logging transactions done to a contract), we have a similar feature (logging logs / events emitted by a contract), but I wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t call that competition.\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Lake, FastNear neardata: they are data sources, not indexers.\\\\\\\\n- QueryAPI: Also allows indexing blockchain events, but has some disadvantages: 1) Rust is faster and more reliable than javascript (not even typescript), which matters quite a lot when you process 5000 receipts per second, 2) the environment is quite limited, you can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have heavy state without pulling it from database every block, access external resources, 3) sometimes you may want to self-host to save money (and from what I\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve heard, QueryAPI is definitely not the cheapest service to maintain), to process the whole database locally, use external packages (not sure if it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible with QueryAPI), or choose a database that is most efficient for specific types of queries, which is quite important for databases with millions / billions of events. All of these disadvantages are also advantages for certain use cases. Some simple use cases might not even need to have their own indexer and just use our historical log event API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Current Market Size\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight now, most dapps don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any realtime functionality or indexers. But the UX of pretty much every dapp can be significantly improved if you add realtime updates or transaction history, so almost every dapp is a potential user of our APIs. The biggest dapps (Ref, Burrow) do have their own indexers, but these dapps took years of development and have enough resources to dedicate to this, while new startups struggle to even make an MVP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for the Telegram bot, it already has features that can be of interest to any type of NEAR user: traders, investors, builders, degens, DAOs, and adding a mini block explorer, as well as more events that can be tracked, will increase the market even more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `inindexer`: Used by meme.cooking and a few other projects that are not yet on mainnet (or I don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know project names, just received some DMs from people asking about it).\\\\\\\\n- `inevents`: Used only by us, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not yet ready for public use and not published on crates.io.\\\\\\\\n- APIs: Recently, we started offering private API service, and our [first](https://x.com/Dragon_Tech_Bot/status/1836125531596619869) user is [Dragon Tech](https://t.me/Dragon_Tech_Bot).\\\\\\\\n- Tearbot: Used by traders, investors, and degens. The brightest example that is publicly available is probably [DoubleDog launch](https://t.me/intearchat/2485) where our users dominated the market because they had a tool. (the message was posted by me, but by that time, 2 users have already bought). There are lots of these tools on other chains, lack of them on NEAR makes a huge difference in trading / degen / investing experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$18,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopment: $12,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware: $6,000:\\\\\\\\n- One-time set up cost of a bare metal server with 4x 8Tb SSDs: $5,000. Not many service providers offer 20+ Tb of SSD storage on a single instance, so our choice is quite limited. The CPU / RAM requirements for our services are very low (we used to run on a $32/mo VPS until recently), and the SSD storage is not going to have frequent rewrites, so the options we have from cloud service providers are an overkill for our use case (for 20Tb, Hetzner - $1200/mo, AWS cheapest aurora - $2000/mo, AWS cheapest gp3 - $1600/mo, not including egress), so investing in a bare metal server is a better choice that will return the investment in a couple of months.\\\\\\\\n- Storage for snapshots and server runtime: $1,000. We acknowledge that during the early stages of adoption, there probably won\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be a huge mission-critical demand for downloading our database snapshots, and they will be chunked by event type (most event types weight less than 1% of the total database size), so there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no need to spend too much on fast download speeds until it becomes a problem that needs a solution.\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"slimedragon.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"18000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"slimedragon.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

Then found another gap - a tip bot that can send arbitrary tokens, not just near, and is easy to connect, and have been adding more functionality ever since. During TPS spikes caused by HOT Wallet events, the bot stopped working, as well as, dexscreener, near.org RPCs, and some of the other indexers, so we decided to rewrite the bot from scratch with performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in mind, and eventually decided to create public APIs for anyone to use the infrastructure that powers our new bot. The main developer (Slime) has been developing games for 7 years, joined crypto in early 2022 and Near in December 2023. Github: https://github.com/Sliman4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Any affiliations with other NEAR ecosystem partners?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in some way connected to a big chunk of the ecosystem, but our closest partnership is with Shitzu. A modified version of our tip bot is used in Shitzu Boost, one of the biggest marketing initiatives used by NEAR ecosystem, our bot had meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual tokens\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" support on the same time as meme.cooking launched, and we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re actively discussing building new things together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot really affiliations, but I think it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth mentioning that we have the most popular and our telegram bot is used by almost all NEAR projects, particularly memecoins but also a lot of development chats like NEAR Dev, and general-audience chats like NEAR Protocol Official, Meteor Russian, and many more. Regarding unrelated to infra, we used to participate in Ref Finance\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Meme Season event and Shitzu\\\\\\\\\\\\'s memecoin index until recently (we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to freeze our token soon), are participating in TextRoyale tournament (game that uses Bitte Wallet in telegram), joining development initiatives such as building a [Bitte Agent](https://wallet.bitte.ai/smart-actions/prompt/how%20can%20you%20assist%20me%3F?mode=debug&agentId=tokens-agent.intear.tech) that fetches price data from prices.intear.tech, [MoreTPS leaderboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) that uses a custom indexer and Intear APIs, and have many unannounced collabs with tech projects in the ecosystem, and among the most recent ones, will probably help the ecosystem [be a safer place](https://t.me/neardev/57416).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Professional Experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near worked as a freelancer for ~7 years, mostly making Minecraft plugins, sometimes tried starting own projects. One of the crypto-related projects was [WalletConnectMC](https://github.com/CraftToken/WalletConnectMC) which provided a decentralized and frictionless connection, and optional wallet-less onboarding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples of relevant experience with NEAR blockchain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/INTEARnear/ has a lot of repos with NEAR code:\\\\\\\\n- [`inevents`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inevents/) is our API framework that is not stable yet, but public API documentation is available at [Intear Docs](https://docs.intear.tech). It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a framework that can be easily extended with other types of events and be self-hosted. In short, it takes an event schema, event stream from Redis (emitted by some indexer), saves it in a database, and provides HTTP / WebSocket APIs to access historical and realtime data\\\\\\\\n- [`inindexer`](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) - framework for building indexers that handles all boilerplate for you (ctrl-c handlers, continue-on-interrupt, combine receipts into transactions, etc.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow are our products built on top of these 2:\\\\\\\\n- [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) contains open source code of t.me/bettearbot, a bot that has notifications about certain transactions, Near.social / BOS / DAO notifications, near-cli-rs in Telegram, and much more, [partially open source](https://github.com/INTEARnear/Tear)\\\\\\\\n- [TPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/) - lightweight TPS tracker that uses `inevents` API as data source, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-dashboard)\\\\\\\\n- [Trades demo](https://trades-demo.intear.tech/?account=aldor.near) shows historical trades and adds new trades in realtime, using `inevents` API, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/trades-demo)\\\\\\\\n- [NFT demo](https://nft-demo.intear.tech/) is a fork of https://nft.near.stream/ that uses `inevents`, [github](https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-mints)\\\\\\\\n- [Oracle marketplace](https://github.com/INTEARnear/oracle) that uses yielded execution + `inindexer` to listen for requests. Can potentially do IPFS upload / download, zkfetch with Reclaim Protocol, AI inference, get data from other chains for chain abstraction, and many other. Currently, not maintained, but we have plans to continue its development in October-November.\\\\\\\\n- [Redacted explorer](https://explorer.intear.tech/token/wrap.near) - a WIP block explorer built on top of our APIs, [github](https://github.com/redacted-explorer/redacted-explorer-frontend).\\\\\\\\n- [Charts](https://codepen.io/Sliman4/pen/jOgOgpz) - TradingView charts that get information about tokens from Intear token APIs (token search + OHLC).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@slimedragon.near\\\\\\\\\\\\'s personal examples of experience:\\\\\\\\n- [RPC Selector](https://github.com/Sliman4/rpc-selector) browser extension that redirects all RPC requests to a custom one\\\\\\\\n- [Abstraction is inevitable](https://medium.com/@slimedragon/chain-abstraction-8d7dbd110d09) (article that was published before there were docs on docs.near.org)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-House Resources;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDesign, BD, Project Management, User Support, Frontend, Backend, QA.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis proposal includes this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Open-source indexers in https://github.com/INTEARnear/, are almost done, but they need to be maintained and some minor features have to be added / fixed:\\\\\\\\n   - NFT transfer / mint / burn: https://github.com/INTEARnear/nft-indexer. Needs a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"trade\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" event for trades on Mintbase, Paras, TradePort, MITTE. There are solutions that index NFT trades, but they don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work with non-standard custodial exchanges like MITTE, which generates the most NFT volume. This will be done when / if MITTE gets out of beta.\\\\\\\\n   - Potlock project / pot donation indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/potlock-indexer. Would be nice to support potlock\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" feature for custom project registries, but the official frontend doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t allow creating lists, and no one is using them, so this is not included in this proposal.\\\\\\\\n   - Trade indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/trade-indexer. Has different events for fetching events as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"balance changes after tx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"one pool at a time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pool change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (triggered on swaps, liquidity add / remove, anything that triggers state change). Currently supports Ref Finance, ref.hot.tg, Dragonbot, meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"staking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, and we were planning to support other DEXes, but it seems they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not as active, so for now, this indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need any changes.\\\\\\\\n   - New token deployment indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/new-token-indexer. It supports all NEP-141 tokens (tkn.near, tknx.near, token0.near, and custom contracts), as well as meme.cooking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tokens, but it has to be extended with an ability to detect new NFT contracts.\\\\\\\\n   - SocialDB indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/socialdb-indexer. Supports notifications, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t support posts, replies, and other non-`index` fields, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to, since near social has their own indexer.\\\\\\\\n   - TPS indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/tps-indexer. Basic information about every block, such as transaction / receipt count, producer, block time. An API with pagination could be more useful than fetching every block from RPC one by one. This indexer is fully done and doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need changes.\\\\\\\\n   - Price indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/price-indexer. Calculates prices of different tokens so that realtime or historical information about prices can be retrieved. Providers [Ref](https://indexer.ref.finance/list-token-price)-[compatible](https://prices.intear.tech/list-token-price) interface for fetching prices. It has auto-discovery of new tokens thanks to new token indexer mentioned above, starting to track their prices immediately, and has a [spam list](https://prices.intear.tech/token-spam-list) that is moderated by AI every time a new token comes out (can be useful to wallets and permissionless dapps), [token search](https://prices.intear.tech/token-search?q=intear) with intelligent ranking based on project reputation, full / partial query match, market capitalization, and other factors. It needs to also include the token liquidity into the ranking calculation, add daily / weekly / monthly / total volume, and a lot more small features. Also needs to have an ability to backfill data.\\\\\\\\n   - FT indexer: Mint, burn, transfer events, that can be filtered by sender / receiver. Fully implemented.\\\\\\\\n   - Transaction indexer: Contains basic information about transactions and receipts, just enough to be able to build a blockchain explorer. Needs a few iterations to see what people want to filter by, but mostly done.\\\\\\\\n   - Liquidity indexer: LP add / remove / lock / unlock events, top liquidity holders. Add / remove events are implemented, but locks are not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Aurora transactions, Aurora Cloud appchain transactions, chain signatures, maybe HOT MPC events (TBD, based on demand). Not implemented yet.\\\\\\\\n   - Log indexer: https://github.com/INTEARnear/log-indexer. Supports text logs and NEP-297 events, but these types of events are not stored and can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be accessed using our historical event API due to the volume of logs. This will be fixed if we can afford more storage, and for now we just have the same thing as `near.stream`. It would be a powerful tool that may remove the need for indexers in some apps. For example, some users in our Telegram chat were complaining about Burrow not showing liquidation logs, so we added notifications using realtime logs API. If we could retrieve filtered history of logs for a specific contract + specific event (e.g. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"liquidate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), that could remove the need for custom dapp indexers entirely. We\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to make a standard that allows indexing / filtering inside events, not just by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" / \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", that will make some smart contract developers almost never write custom indexers - https://t.me/neardev/57114. The feedback seems to be positive, but we need to figure out a way to scale it, or make it a paid service.\\\\\\\\n   - Some of the above have a testnet counterpart, but some don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t. Where applicable, all events should have a testnet version of the event.\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inindexer` crate.\\\\\\\\n2. HTTP / WebSocket APIs are [already live](https://docs.intear.tech), they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re [somewhat reliable](https://status.intear.tech/), but need some work to become production-ready:\\\\\\\\n   - Implement better DDoS protection, rate limiting, improve database performance (the current queries were made as a fast prototype and half of them are not used by anyone in production).\\\\\\\\n   - Get better hardware. We estimate that we will need about 20 Tb of storage to sync with mainnet and have enough until the beginning of 2025, with a projection of 5% monthly growth.\\\\\\\\n   - Get more user feedback to make the APIs easier to use, especially when it comes to getting both historical and realtime data together.\\\\\\\\n   - Synchronize with mainnet from genesis block to include the full history of events.\\\\\\\\n   - Upload weekly or daily database dumps so that everyone can extract any data they want.\\\\\\\\n   - Auto-generated Typescript library for accessing these APIs (same way as we auto-generate [swagger ui](https://events.intear.tech/query/swagger-ui/)).\\\\\\\\n   - This includes maintenance of `inevents` crate.\\\\\\\\n   - Service credits equal to the amount of this proposal, that can be spent on private API servers or any other services that are listed in the body of this proposal.\\\\\\\\n3. [Tearbot](https://t.me/bettearbot) Telegram bot:\\\\\\\\n   - Support of all above mentioned events (where applicable), so that users can receive notifications about all kinds of transactions with flexible and user-friendly filtering options.\\\\\\\\n   - `/price`, `/chart` command so that people can see TradingView token charts in Telegram. Currently, the closest alternative that exists in our bot is `/token`.\\\\\\\\n   - History of account transactions, token swaps, and other events (basically a mini block explorer in Telegram that covers most popular use cases)\\\\\\\\n   - Realtime tracking of all actions of a wallet (outgoing tx, incoming tx, incoming FT / NFT, etc.)\\\\\\\\n   - All features included in this proposal will be open-source, and existing private features will gradually become open-source once we reach certain milestones (TBD) of total users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Goals / Milestones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal is to:\\\\\\\\n- Have all the indexers mentioned above done in 1 month after this proposal is approved\\\\\\\\n- Have an improved HTTP / WebSocket API live in 2 months, with at least 99% uptime the first month after the upgrade.\\\\\\\\n- Make all APIs and libraries production-ready and stable in 3 months.\\\\\\\\n- Release Tearbot features as soon as they\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done, but no later than in 2 months\\\\\\\\n- Have everything above documented on docs.intear.tech, with video tutorials where they would be useful\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Metrics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the metrics that will be tracked:\\\\\\\\n- Projects using `inindexer` (I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m aware of 2 private codebases that use it on mainnet now, and a few people reached out to me asking about it, but not sure about the current status)\\\\\\\\n- Dapps and wallets using HTTP / WebSocket APIs (currently 1 known and a few more unidentified ones)\\\\\\\\n- Historical API requests per month (currently it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s around 2,000,000)\\\\\\\\n- Users of our Telegram bots (currently about 3,000 total, and hard to tell how many are active because people can just set up the bot once and receive notifications without reconfiguring it ever since)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Competitor Comparison\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks API has more detailed historical data, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have high-level \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-like APIs. Also, judging by my own, and other telegram bot developers\\\\\\\\\\\\' experience, Nearblocks API has had consistently less-than-ideal uptime, to the point that Dragon Tech bot had to stop using it in favor of Pikespeak, then switched back for some unknown reason, and in one of the most important moments for the NEAR degen ecosystem, the launch of $CHILL last week, Nearblocks went down for 12 hours straight, and $CHILL closed their telegram chat until the bot starts working. It was resolved by setting up our bot, which had no problems with real-time APIs at that time.\\\\\\\\n- Pikespeak API has high-level event data for some events, as well as detailed historical data, but lacks realtime APIs, doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have all events that Intear has, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not as easy to add new ones or self-host the API, since it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not open-source. For instance, building TPS Indexer + a custom event for [MoreTPS dashboard](https://tps.intear.tech/?round=beta.moretps.near) + and deploying HTTP + WebSocket APIs for these events took less than 1h30m (not including the frontend, which took an additional hour of prompting websim and editing).\\\\\\\\n- `indexer.ref.finance` provides token price data, but only for whitelisted tokens, and has rate limits, while our indexer doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any limits because we cache our responses for a few seconds instead of fetching data from blockchain every time. Not the most precise way, but totally acceptable for 99.99% of use cases.\\\\\\\\n- `wss://events.near.stream/ws` provides realtime logs from contracts using WebSocket. Our APIs provide more high-level access to on-chain events that can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be extracted from logs, such as FT price changes, with custom filters for each. We provide access to arbitrary logs as well, with server-side filtering with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"starts with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ends with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"contains\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact match\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, as well as NEP-297 parsed logs with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version_semver_compatible\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"predecessor id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" filters, to avoid sending all logs to every user. `events.near.stream` also has server-side filtering, not sure how flexible they are, but I\\\\\\\\\\\\'d say we do the same thing, and there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not much difference which one to choose, unless you want to extract many historical events, in which case we provide HTTP API.\\\\\\\\n- Almost every project maintains their own list of whitelisted and blacklisted (spam) tokens. We have an actively maintained list with free unlimited API usage, automatic spam token flagging using AI, ease of adding a new token through a telegram bot, and various \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of reputation - Spam, Unknown, NotFake, Reputable.\\\\\\\\n- indexer.xyz and Mintbase provide NFT data, they have much more data than Intear because they specialize in NFTs, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not trying to compete with them.\\\\\\\\n- FastNear provides indexers for staking and tokens, but our APIs don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t intersect. In fact, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using FastNear for some of the features in our telegram bot Tearbot.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Bot: It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a trading bot, while our bot is mainly informational, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not competing. By the way, we participated in their trading competition as a memecoin in March.\\\\\\\\n- Dragon Tech: It has one feature that is the same as our bot (buy notifications), but our bot has more customizations. As for the other features, the Dragon Tech developer and me have unofficially decided to move in different directions, Dragon Tech will focus on safety (captcha, portal, moderation) while our bot will have blockchain-related features.\\\\\\\\n- LNC Watcher Bot: It has only 1 simple feature (logging transactions done to a contract), we have a similar feature (logging logs / events emitted by a contract), but I wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t call that competition.\\\\\\\\n- NEAR Lake, FastNear neardata: they are data sources, not indexers.\\\\\\\\n- QueryAPI: Also allows indexing blockchain events, but has some disadvantages: 1) Rust is faster and more reliable than javascript (not even typescript), which matters quite a lot when you process 5000 receipts per second, 2) the environment is quite limited, you can\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have heavy state without pulling it from database every block, access external resources, 3) sometimes you may want to self-host to save money (and from what I\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve heard, QueryAPI is definitely not the cheapest service to maintain), to process the whole database locally, use external packages (not sure if it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible with QueryAPI), or choose a database that is most efficient for specific types of queries, which is quite important for databases with millions / billions of events. All of these disadvantages are also advantages for certain use cases. Some simple use cases might not even need to have their own indexer and just use our historical log event API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Current Market Size\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight now, most dapps don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any realtime functionality or indexers. But the UX of pretty much every dapp can be significantly improved if you add realtime updates or transaction history, so almost every dapp is a potential user of our APIs. The biggest dapps (Ref, Burrow) do have their own indexers, but these dapps took years of development and have enough resources to dedicate to this, while new startups struggle to even make an MVP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for the Telegram bot, it already has features that can be of interest to any type of NEAR user: traders, investors, builders, degens, DAOs, and adding a mini block explorer, as well as more events that can be tracked, will increase the market even more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage & Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `inindexer`: Used by meme.cooking and a few other projects that are not yet on mainnet (or I don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know project names, just received some DMs from people asking about it).\\\\\\\\n- `inevents`: Used only by us, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not yet ready for public use and not published on crates.io.\\\\\\\\n- APIs: Recently, we started offering private API service, and our [first](https://x.com/Dragon_Tech_Bot/status/1836125531596619869) user is [Dragon Tech](https://t.me/Dragon_Tech_Bot).\\\\\\\\n- Tearbot: Used by traders, investors, and degens. The brightest example that is publicly available is probably [DoubleDog launch](https://t.me/intearchat/2485) where our users dominated the market because they had a tool. (the message was posted by me, but by that time, 2 users have already bought). There are lots of these tools on other chains, lack of them on NEAR makes a huge difference in trading / degen / investing experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Budget\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n$18,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Budget Breakdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopment: $12,000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware: $6,000:\\\\\\\\n- One-time set up cost of a bare metal server with 4x 8Tb SSDs: $5,000. Not many service providers offer 20+ Tb of SSD storage on a single instance, so our choice is quite limited. The CPU / RAM requirements for our services are very low (we used to run on a $32/mo VPS until recently), and the SSD storage is not going to have frequent rewrites, so the options we have from cloud service providers are an overkill for our use case (for 20Tb, Hetzner - $1200/mo, AWS cheapest aurora - $2000/mo, AWS cheapest gp3 - $1600/mo, not including egress), so investing in a bare metal server is a better choice that will return the investment in a couple of months.\\\\\\\\n- Storage for snapshots and server runtime: $1,000. We acknowledge that during the early stages of adoption, there probably won\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be a huge mission-critical demand for downloading our database snapshots, and they will be chunked by event type (most event types weight less than 1% of the total database size), so there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no need to spend too much on fast download speeds until it becomes a problem that needs a solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDiscussion on GitHub - https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/discussions/156\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"slimedragon.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"18000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [\"Indexers\", \"Explorers\"]}"

This solution greatly increased transaction success rates and minimized errors that affected all RPC services on NEAR, degrading critical services like Meteor Wallet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Boosting Ref Finance latency and loading times**\\\\\\\\nBy identifying and caching the most crucial API calls for app.ref.finance, we dramatically improved user experience and loading times.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### In-house resources\\\\\\\\n- Design UX/UI\\\\\\\\n- Project management\\\\\\\\n- Customer Support\\\\\\\\n- BD and marketing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Testimonials\\\\\\\\n**Daniel - CPO at Altiplanic, Evmos:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\u{201c}Lava has been a valuable partner in offering public RPC endpoints on Evmos. Their innovative approach of decentralizing RPC endpoints via incentivization has notably improved the stability, quality, and visibility or RPC services on the Evmos chain.

Their support team has consistently been available to address any issues, often going above and beyond to implement fixes, even on weekends.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**ShardDog:**\\\\\\\\n*\\\\\\\\u{201c}At ShardDog, Lava has quickly become an important piece within our tech stack. As usage grows but we stay as a small team, we need reliable infra to handle the scaling. Since adding this to our front-end and back-end APIs, it has allowed us to focus on improving our product instead of the infrastructure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"8d51039cd656f1d9716894420b62555b68022797e7214adf4f630c77caf1cf66\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"infrastructure-committee.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V1\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"336000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"author_id\": \"8d51039cd656f1d9716894420b62555b68022797e7214adf4f630c77caf1cf66\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
