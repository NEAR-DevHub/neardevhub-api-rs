We prioritized two key goals: empowering developers and fostering a thriving community. We dove into more details in our recent episode of [DevHub Live](https://youtube.com/live/tWNdPtQsMwo), but here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a quick recap of the exciting initiatives that fueled our progress and a glimpse into what\\\\\\\\u{2019}s coming up next in Q3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Q2 Highlights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f6e0}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Tooling**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Ledger Integration:** Finalize and security audited the NEAR App for Ledger devices. We plan to launch soon after Ledger\\\\\\\\u{2019}s new Stax device release. This integration will bring greater security to NEAR users.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **CLI Enhancements:** Streamlined CLI tooling, making it easier for newcomers to the NEAR ecosystem and resulting in faster development cycles.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **SDK Upgrade:** Released near-sdk-js 2.0, empowering JavaScript developers to create robust smart contracts.\\\\\\\\u{a0}\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f4da} Developer Support**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Chain Abstraction:** Placed chain abstraction at the forefront of our educational efforts. New documentation pages with clear explanations and hands-on examples make it easier for developers to create applications that seamlessly span multiple blockchains.\\\\\\\\n*   **Documentation Overhaul:** Revamped resources with intuitive navigation, fresh onboarding examples, and a series of \\\\\\\\u{201c}What is\\\\\\\\u{2026}\\\\\\\\u{201d} pages that break down complex concepts. Standardized tutorials now ensure a consistent learning experience across the board.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f31f} DevHub Portal**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **New Proposal Experience:** Launched a new [streamlined proposal workflow](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=3251) that facilitates a smoother funding journey. In Q2 alone, this system facilitated over $500,000 in funding across 80 proposals. Since launching our platform, over 17 open source community contributors have helped close 400 PRs in the DevHub GitHub repo.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **Scaling DevHub Portal:** Introduced committee portals for the events and infrastructure committees. This expansion marks a significant step towards a common layer that supports decision making & funding across ecosystem projects.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f91d} Community Engagement**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **NEAR Dev News:** Published 12 newsletters in Q2 with a 40% average open rate and subscriber base of 889. NEAR Dev News has become the go-to source for ecosystem updates and is gaining traction across regional communities, with the Ludium community translating content into local languages.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **DevHub Live:** Launched a weekly DevHub live call to feature prominent people and news in the ecosystem. So far, our 12 episodes have averaged 100-150 live viewers, with an additional 500+ views from replays.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **Social Growth:** Increased social media presence with 337 social media posts featuring original video content., reaching over 143k impressions.
