The larger NEAR ecosystem has benefited by reducing the amount of time spent by the NF Legal and Finance team members, as well as DevHub admins, on the proposal payment process. These process improvements brought additional controls ensuring overall accuracy as DevHub has a fiduciary responsibility to NF that grant funds are spent responsibly, payments are correct and appropriate KYC/KYB measures have been taken.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWeek 08/26/2024 - 08/30/2024\\\\\\\\nThere were some reconcilation variances in the CRM that required some extra research and attention.
