We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Mission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Vision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Example areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The Funding Board shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our funding guidelines.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Overview\"}, {\"id\": \"2te4j0\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to get help\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Welcome to DevHub!

If you have a project that improves the NEAR developer experience, DevDAO may be able to provide funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## About DevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO is the primary organization behind DevHub. Our mission is to build a thriving, self-sufficient NEAR developer community by focusing on developer onboarding and engagement.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe support initiatives that make it easier for developers to get started with NEAR, engage with the community, and contribute successfully. Example areas:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevTools**: SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and documentation (Rust and JS stacks) that streamline development.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevRel**: Activities that onboard and engage developers including tutorials, guides, onboarding experiences, community support channels, and IRL/online events.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevHub Portal**: Creating essential tools for managing proposals, treasury, and community collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe want to fund projects that positively impact the NEAR developer journey. Here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what we look for:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Funding Journey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the NEAR developer community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves the key stages below.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 1: Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe proposal life cycle begins when an author submits a draft. During the draft stage, the proposal is open for community comments and the author can still make changes and build consensus.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Get Started**: To submit a draft, navigate to the [/proposals](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals) feed page and click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is a good idea to browse other proposals to learn from previous efforts and consider how your proposal differs from or builds upon existing ideas. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Fill Out Your Draft**: Complete these required fields:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Category: Select the category that best aligns with your project or contribution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Title: Craft a concise and descriptive title that captures the essence of your proposal in a few words. This will appear on your proposal\\\\\\\\u{2019}s detail page and the main proposal feed. Keep it short, please. (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Streamlined Onboarding Tutorials for New NEAR Developers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Summary: Briefly explain your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s goals and the benefits it brings to the NEAR developer community. (Consider using a problem-solution approach: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Problem: New developers struggle to find clear onboarding resources. Solution: We propose creating interactive tutorials...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Description: Expand on your summary with details like your contribution timeline, key milestones, team background, and a clear breakdown of how the funds will be used. Keep the description simple and easy to understand. Proposals should be simple and clear (e.g. 1 month). For more complex projects, treat each milestone as a separate proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Other Fields: Complete all other remaining fields, including KYC/KYB Verification, funding amount, currency preference, NEAR wallet address, requested sponsor, and consent to the Terms & Conditions and Code of Conduct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Submit or Continue Editing**: Click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Submit Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to post the draft to the community, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to start the official review process with DevDAO. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in draft mode. To edit the proposal, click Edit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 2: Review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Move to Review**: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for DevDAO to review your proposal, change the status to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for Review.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This moves your proposal to the review stage and locks the editing function, but comments are still open. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in Review mode. At this point, DevDAO may consider reviewing your proposal. DevHub Community Managers review submitted proposals on a weekly cadence and request from the appropriate Work Groups or DevHub moderators to review. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Community Input**: Your proposal is open for discussion. Engage with the community, consider suggestions, and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Sponsor Review**: DevDAO Moderators review submitted proposals on a regular cadence and may consult relevant working groups for input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNote: If you wish to cancel your proposal, you can click Cancel Proposal. This changes the status to Canceled, signaling to DevDAO that it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s no longer active or relevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 3: Decision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevDAO Evaluation** DevDAO Moderators consider community feedback, available budget, alignment with focus areas, and various other factors to make a collaborative decision. Once the DevDAO Moderators update the decision, they will add a comment to the sponsorship to indicate the decision & next steps. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Possible Decisions**: Approved, Approved (Conditional), Rejected, Canceled (by the author).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 4: Payment Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **KYC/KYB Verification**: If the proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will move the proposal to the Payment Processing stage and first verify that you have already completed KYC/KYB verification to ensure legal compliance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Information Collection & Legal Steps (with NEAR Foundation)**: Once verified, DevDAO moderators will request for you to complete the following required steps with the NEAR Foundation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t1. Complete the Funding Request using the Airtable form.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t2. Sign the agreement after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation legal team using Ironclad.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t3. Submit the final invoice after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation finance team using Request Finance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t4. Confirm the test transaction after receiving a test transaction confirmation email from the NEAR Foundation finance team. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Payment Disbursement**: Typically, funds are disbursed within 10 business days, but timelines may vary.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 5: Funded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Transparency**: Once funded, payment details are made public on the proposal page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Need More Help?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have further questions, please post a comment on the [DevHub Platform](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=devhub-platform&tab=discussions) community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding\"}, {\"id\": \"p6oi6p\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"kanban\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"metadata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d75543a-74d7f407-7399035d--1d4c470b--618b59a7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kanban.post_board\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Funding Board\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ticket\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kanban.post_ticket\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"features\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"author\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"like_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reply_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sponsorship_request_indicator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"requested_sponsorship_value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"requested_sponsor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"approved_sponsorship_value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sponsorship_supervisor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true}}},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"payload\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"columns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d76a815--1edac41b--3ce2a206--9bdb7ae--37dcbaae\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-new-request\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d76a815--1edac41b--3ce2a206--9bdb7ae--37dcbaae\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d794c2e--48bb331e--23b4b2de--272c8ae4-6eaf133c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-information-collection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get Info\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get details\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d794c2e--48bb331e--23b4b2de--272c8ae4-6eaf133c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d79e6dd-21c0f704-601485dc--5cce796e-6bcfcd0e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d79e6dd-21c0f704-601485dc--5cce796e-6bcfcd0e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7a6b4b--2256b752--3a17ea80--501fa43c-2b579107\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7a6b4b--2256b752--3a17ea80--501fa43c-2b579107\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7aa83f-3c05aa44-6dfce22b--15d06696-303e0016\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-funded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Paid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7aa83f-3c05aa44-6dfce22b--15d06696-303e0016\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"excluded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[]}}}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding Board\"}], \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

To get started, all you need is some spare time, a computer with Node.js installed, and a GitHub account.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## New to NEAR?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re new in the ecosystem, consider contributing by choosing a specific topic and following the documentation from start to finish. For instance, you can go through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"building smart contracts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" docs and take notes on any areas where you face challenges\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA web developer with real world experience in building applications (specially backend technologies) should be able to go through the docs. If you have such expertise and do not manage to understand the docs, then you have found a documentation problem! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, reach out through Telegram or Discord to seek clarification and then contribute by improving the docs to benefit others with your newfound knowledge.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Forking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a local instance of the docs: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Fork the official docs repository \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. Navigate to the `website` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. Install all dependencies by running (`npm install`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. Start a local version of the docs by running (`npm start`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Modifying an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Locate the relevant markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Edit the markdown file to make your desired changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you dont know which article corresponds to a specific markdown file, simply use the `Edit this page` button at the end of every article.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Creating an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a new article:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Add the new article to the `sidebar.json` file. This will add it to the navigation sidebar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAwesome! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve successfully added new content to the docs \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBut keep in mind, building good documentation can be a challenging task and yet...surprisingly straightforward. The reason is simple: it is hard to write educational material, but it is very simple to evaluate its usefulness. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis guide on ***[The Art of Writing good Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYNNlqu36-k44LN86KL8332ldAlgr84ql_2lcnyRYW8/edit?usp=sharing )*** will give you the right mindset to keep throughout your creative process: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Tool Developers***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a tool developer, you can contribute by:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Creating documentation for your tool and other tools used in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Standardizing repositories\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Contributing to typedocs and READMEs to enhance the usability of NEAR tools.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Specific Tasks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor a list of specific tasks to work on, refer to this [***LINK***](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1SK-a50ZZBEG_RU6Je04CeVlr23bjodS65jz_EJDKiUo/mobilebasic).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Your contributions play a vital role in improving NEAR documentation and making it more accessible to everyone***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Get Involved \\\\\\\\u{1f3c6}\"}, {\"id\": \"5dhk1o\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Documentation Updates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"## Feb 16th 2024 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.

By collaborating on the developer productivity tools for NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Blockchain Operating System [BOS], Zero Knowledge [ZK], and Smart Contracts, community members can foster innovation and enrich our developer community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Why is it needed?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs the NEAR ecosystem grows rapidly, there is an increasing need to improve developer productivity. While open-source communities are essential to manage these needs, new developers may find it challenging to get started. The DevDAO NEAR Platform Fellowship Program aims to solve this issue by providing guidance to new contributors from experienced developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### What are the focus areas?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO focuses on improving work in the following strategic areas within the NEAR ecosystem:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Blockchain Operating System implementation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Zero Knowledge SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- JavaScript on-chain and off-chain SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Rust on-chain and off-chain SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Mobile development (native iOS/Android, and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWithin each area, there are a number of tasks to complete, including developing security and contract development toolkits, creating productivity tools, and maintaining open-source repositories. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO wants to prioritize contributions to the following repositories: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [docs](https://github.com/near/docs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-api-js](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-jsonrpc-client-rs](https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-sdk-rs](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-sdk-js](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [workspaces-rs](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [workspaces-js](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [wallet-selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [create-near-app](https://github.com/near/create-near-app)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How does it work?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\'s NEAR Platform Fellowship Program is a way for active and experienced NEAR developers to empower new contributors and solve the focus areas above. Here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s it works: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Apply**: Experienced contributors apply to become a Fellowship Leader by submitting a proposal on DevHub. The proposal must include a timeline, budget to allocate to new contributors, and a focus area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Approve**: DevDAO and the NEAR community review the proposal to ensure that it aligns with the NEAR community goals and that the budget is reasonable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Invite**: Upon acceptance, the Fellowship Leader invites new contributors to participate in the project. The Fellowship Leader is responsible for evaluating and negotiating compensation (see [funding guidelines](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/near-developer-governance-funding-guidelines)) with the new contributors. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Execute**: Once the team is assembled, they can begin working on the project. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Compensate**: Once the work is complete, contributors submit their contribution report on DevHub. The Fellowship Leader must provide an attestation to confirm the work and compensation amount. DevDAO will then work to issue the payment.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo help bootstrap the program, DevDAO invites experienced developers to apply from various expert entities such as Pagoda, Aurora, Proximity, Human Guild, and Calimero. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to submit a fellowship proposal?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSubmit a fellowship proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](http://neardevhub.org) using these guidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create a new \\\\\\\\u{201c}Solution\\\\\\\\u{201d} post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship\\\\\\\\u{201d} and \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship-proposal\\\\\\\\u{201d} labels to your post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Provide a clear description of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Describe the skills and experience you are looking for from new contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Set a budget for your fellowship using the [funding guidelines](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/near-developer-governance-funding-guidelines). Note that the compensation will get paid directly from DevDAO to contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce you have submitted your proposal, the DevDAO team will review it and provide feedback. If your proposal is approved, you can start recruiting fellow contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to be a great fellowship leader?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs a Fellowship Leader, your role is crucial in empowering successful contributions to our ecosystem. To be an effective leader, it is essential to perform several key tasks:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Define the scope of work**: Submit a well-defined proposal with clear goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Find contributors**: Utilize networking, various community groups, and applications left on DevHub as comments to your proposal to find contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Onboard contributors**: Set clear expectations, including your availability and communication guidelines. Additionally, provide well-defined tasks with the relevant context and acceptance criteria.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Oversee execution**: Deliver quality results that meet the needs of our ecosystem by monitoring the project, providing feedback to contributors, and promptly responding to questions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to be a great contributor?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNew contributors play an essential role in our ecosystem, bringing fresh perspectives and ideas. If you\\\\\\\\u{2019}re looking to make meaningful contributions and gain guidance from experienced developers, here are some tips to help you get started: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Apply to a fellowship**: Find [available fellowship proposals on NEAR DevHub](/devhub.near/widget/app?page=feed&tag=fellowship-proposal) and leave a comment with your application for a project that interests you.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Align with your Fellowship Leader**: If you are selected, it is important to align with your Fellowship Leader on the expectations and requirements for the project.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Be self-sufficient**: While your Fellowship Leader is there to guide you, it is important to become self-sufficient quickly and focus on completing your work. This means taking initiative to learn and communicating when you need support.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Provide updates**: Post a contribution report on DevHub to provide transparency and potentially to get compensated.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Keep improving**: As you gain more knowledge and experience, we hope that you continue to contribute to our ecosystem and share your insights to enable others to contribute too.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to submit a contribution report?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, DevDAO requires all contributors to submit a contribution report on the [NEAR DevHub](http://neardevhub.org) once the work is complete using these guidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create a new \\\\\\\\u{201c}Solution\\\\\\\\u{201d} post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship\\\\\\\\u{201d} and \\\\\\\\u{201c}contribution-report\\\\\\\\u{201d} labels to your post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the requested compensation amount\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- In the description, reference the relevant fellowship proposal post.
