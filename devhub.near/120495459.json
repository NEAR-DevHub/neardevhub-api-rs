This post dives further into the ideation area.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step in any NEAR ecosystem project is ideation. It is crucial to have a way to find people to share and explore ideas with, partly because it can save a lot of time based on prior discussions. But also because it can help strengthen your ideas & gauge support from a diversity of stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are three ways to get started:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Sharing ideas on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to share an idea is in the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Anyone can add an idea in any shape or form. The more your idea is fleshed out, the higher chances it will receive votes and comments. By posting an idea, you are inviting others to comment or propose their solutions. It is critical to specify what sort of response you are hoping for.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow to share an idea:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1) Check for prior ideas:** Before posting your idea, please search the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) for similar ideas to learn from previous efforts. If you find a similar idea, consider how your proposed idea differs from or builds upon the existing one. If you already have a solution in mind, consider responding with a Solution Post to an existing idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2) Create a post:** In the [proposal feed](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), Click Create Idea and fill out all the fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Posting guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Labels \\\\\\\\u{2013} The appropriate label categories\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Title \\\\\\\\u{2013}  A short summary of the proposed idea\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Description \\\\\\\\u{2013} The relevant information and rationale to enable the community to provide feedback. Describe the problem or opportunity your idea is addressing, as well as your desired outcome. It is also helpful to include a clear call to action for community members, such as asking for feedback on how to improve certain aspects of the idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3) Share with the ecosystem:** Once posted, the author is responsible for gathering social support or expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant Community Groups or individuals and leading the discussion further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4) Iterate:** Monitor your post for any replies and take the time to follow up with people who provided feedback. If you are ready to move from idea to implementation, consider submitting a Solution Post to your idea or encouraging others to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample Post:\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifjcyk2cj64aol2uh5pb76brytv3affg335rzczj3tzgkyhuulbtq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Exploring ideas using existing community groups\\\\\\\\nIf you have an early seed for an idea, or a topic area you are interested in exploring, consider joining an existing developer Community Group (CG). CGs are self-organized groups of people interested in a specific topic, such as Zero Knowledge or Wallet Standards. They are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them. They offer a great opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with like-minded people. Most groups have a dedicated social channel, like Telegram, as well as regular  video calls or in-person events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How to engage with an existing group:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Search for groups: Browse the list of existing [Community Groups](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) to familiarize yourself with their topic area, guidelines, and communication channels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Get involved: Join the CG\\\\\\\\u{2019}s dedicated social channel and learn about their recent activities. Don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t forget to introduce yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Join events: Review previous meeting notes/recordings and register for upcoming meetings. In the future, consider volunteering to speak about a topic or even to lead the meeting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Participate in discussions: Comment on existing ideas or discussions. Or propose a new idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample ideas:\\\\\\\\n- A vague wish: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I think it would be great if NEAR supported ZK contracts\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A highly detailed multi-page specification: A  new consensus algorithm\\\\\\\\n- A concern: \\\\\\\\u{201c}near-api-js does not use TypeScript everywhere and it is kinda concerning to me\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A stackoverflow problem: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I cannot figure out how to make Markdown work in near.social\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Starting a new community group\\\\\\\\nIf none of the existing CGs work for you, consider [creating your own CG](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more insights and to stay up to date on our latest updates, sign up for our newsletter below or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NEARDevGov) and [Telegram](https://t.me/NEARDevGov).\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": 2029, \"title\": \"How to ideate on DevHub\", \"author\": \"theori.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"description\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

This post dives further into the ideation area.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step in any NEAR ecosystem project is ideation. It is crucial to have a way to find people to share and explore ideas with, partly because it can save a lot of time based on prior discussions. But also because it can help strengthen your ideas & gauge support from a diversity of stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are three ways to get started:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Sharing ideas on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to share an idea is in the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Anyone can add an idea in any shape or form. The more your idea is fleshed out, the higher chances it will receive votes and comments. By posting an idea, you are inviting others to comment or propose their solutions. It is critical to specify what sort of response you are hoping for.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow to share an idea:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1) Check for prior ideas:** Before posting your idea, please search the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) for similar ideas to learn from previous efforts. If you find a similar idea, consider how your proposed idea differs from or builds upon the existing one. If you already have a solution in mind, consider responding with a Solution Post to an existing idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2) Create a post:** In the [proposal feed](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), Click Create Idea and fill out all the fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Posting guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Labels \\\\\\\\u{2013} The appropriate label categories\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Title \\\\\\\\u{2013}  A short summary of the proposed idea\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Description \\\\\\\\u{2013} The relevant information and rationale to enable the community to provide feedback. Describe the problem or opportunity your idea is addressing, as well as your desired outcome. It is also helpful to include a clear call to action for community members, such as asking for feedback on how to improve certain aspects of the idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3) Share with the ecosystem:** Once posted, the author is responsible for gathering social support or expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant Community Groups or individuals and leading the discussion further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4) Iterate:** Monitor your post for any replies and take the time to follow up with people who provided feedback. If you are ready to move from idea to implementation, consider submitting a Solution Post to your idea or encouraging others to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample Post:\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifjcyk2cj64aol2uh5pb76brytv3affg335rzczj3tzgkyhuulbtq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Exploring ideas using existing community groups\\\\\\\\nIf you have an early seed for an idea, or a topic area you are interested in exploring, consider joining an existing developer Community Group (CG). CGs are self-organized groups of people interested in a specific topic, such as Zero Knowledge or Wallet Standards. They are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them. They offer a great opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with like-minded people. Most groups have a dedicated social channel, like Telegram, as well as regular  video calls or in-person events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How to engage with an existing group:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Search for groups: Browse the list of existing [Community Groups](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) to familiarize yourself with their topic area, guidelines, and communication channels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Get involved: Join the CG\\\\\\\\u{2019}s dedicated social channel and learn about their recent activities. Don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t forget to introduce yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Join events: Review previous meeting notes/recordings and register for upcoming meetings. In the future, consider volunteering to speak about a topic or even to lead the meeting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Participate in discussions: Comment on existing ideas or discussions. Or propose a new idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample ideas:\\\\\\\\n- A vague wish: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I think it would be great if NEAR supported ZK contracts\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A highly detailed multi-page specification: A  new consensus algorithm\\\\\\\\n- A concern: \\\\\\\\u{201c}near-api-js does not use TypeScript everywhere and it is kinda concerning to me\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A stackoverflow problem: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I cannot figure out how to make Markdown work in near.social\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Starting a new community group\\\\\\\\nIf none of the existing CGs work for you, consider [creating your own CG](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more insights and to stay up to date on our latest updates, sign up for our newsletter below or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NEARDevGov) and [Telegram](https://t.me/NEARDevGov).\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": 2029, \"title\": \"How to ideate on DevHub\", \"author\": \"theori.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"description\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}}}"

We will also invite you to our Telegram group with all other previous contributors where you can ask questions and share resources.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe want to create visibility on the progress we are making, so we will ask each contributor to submit a report on DevHub every two weeks with the work they completed.

In this post, we will take a closer look at who determines the funding at DevHub, what factors to consider when proposing the funding amount, and how to submit a funding request.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and empowering anyone to [contribute to the ecosystem](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028). A big part of this is providing financial support to some of the activities that go into bringing innovative projects to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Who determines the funding\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount for a proposal is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, the Work Groups, and the Developer DAO moderators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt starts with the applicant figuring out the appropriate amount to ask for in their proposal based on factors such as project complexity, timeline, and skill levels. Once the applicant posts their proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), various Work Groups evaluate the technical and product aspects of the proposal within their area of expertise. They also assess the project cost considerations, and in some cases negotiate with the applicant. Since Work Groups specialize in different areas, their evaluation may vary. After the Work Groups provide their attestations, the Developer DAO moderators will consolidate the feedback and make the final funding decision. In some cases, the Developer DAO moderators may schedule a public call to meet with the applicant(s) to discuss or negotiate the proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### What factors to consider when determining the funding\\\\\\\\nAll parties mentioned above should use the following factors when determining the funding amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project complexity and duration: Consider the level of effort and the length of the project.\\\\\\\\n- Seniority and skill required for the task. Consider using [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) as a guideline to determine the expected hourly rate for each level of seniority and role.\\\\\\\\n- Temporary nature of the engagement: Adjust for the temporary nature of engagement. Since temporary engagements are less financially secure than full-time job positions, an extra 20-80% markup is potentially justifiable.\\\\\\\\n- Special skills or experience: If the project requires niche skills, such as a proven knowledge of NEAR protocol internals, a person with such skills can justify requesting more compensation.\\\\\\\\n- Economic circumstances: While it is difficult to apply geographic compensation calibration consistently in a blockchain space, it is also unfair to recognize that some teams might have a 4x lower cost of the workforce than other teams due to their geographic location. We expect applicants to be open about it and for Work Groups to enforce [geographic coefficients](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721125654/https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) when the disparity is drastic.\\\\\\\\n- Diversification of the NEAR ecosystem: It is in the interests of DevHub to support multiple entities with funding, rather than giving all grants to a single qualified party. Therefore, in some rare cases, funding may be granted to a party that is slightly less fit but is a newcomer to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Submitting funding requests on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to submit a funding request is through a solution post on [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). You must first create an [idea](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029) post, and reply to it with a solution post type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunding requests guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project details: Include a clear overview of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\n- Budget breakdown: To ensure transparency and increase the chances of approval, the applicant should include a budget breakdown with justification based on the various factors mentioned in the previous section.\\\\\\\\n- Timeline: Projects and their corresponding funding should have a short timeline, preferably under a month. This helps ensure project success by creating a clearly defined scope and minimizing risks.
