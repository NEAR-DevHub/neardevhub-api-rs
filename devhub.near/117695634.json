This technology has various use cases within blockchain, such as enhancing scalability and privacy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis community brings together individuals, experts, and organizations who are interested in developing a ZK ecosystem on NEAR. Our vision is to drive the development of ZK technology and explore its potential applications.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Zero Knowledge community consists of two groups: the community group and the work group working group. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Community Group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis informal self-organized group provides a space for anyone interested in Zero Knowledge and its applications. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to meet with others to share ideas and submit proposals. This group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. The group has a dedicated Telegram channel as well as regular calls every two months.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Working Group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis formal group is a selected committee of subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions related to Zero Knowledge on NEAR. They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO, and hold grant takers accountable. They also engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Members**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Anton Yezhov (@yezhov.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Garvit Goel (@garvit_electron.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Igor Gulamov (@igorgulamov.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Communication Channels \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe ZK community communicates through the [ZK Telegram group](https://t.me/NearZeroKnowledge).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe community also community calls that take place every two months, the recordings can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrLLmjcJVAB9H6Jhm33S7nhwSadQplbGD). These calls give the community a chance to discuss current topics, discuss proposals and share what they have been working on. If you have a topic suggestion please reach out on Telegram.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur next community call is taking place in **June**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## How to get involved \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe best way to get involved is to join the discussion happening in our Telegram and community calls.
