Look out for more examples coming soon! The repo can be found here https://github.com/mattlockyer/mpc-script \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext up was Ben from Mintbase who led a conversation about how the Mintbase team is adding EVM support to the Mintbase Wallet through Wallet Connect. This will allow one to use a NEAR native wallet in any EVM application that supports Wallet Connect (so basically all EVM DApps). The full presentation slides can be found here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rf6IFXHqk6i5sgkOqCdbf5Mg2Mfs-KuU3DUZMcb7E2U/edit#slide=id.g2cfb1e37d94_0_51 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMike from Proximity then announced that in the next couple of weeks, the security audits for the chain signature contracts will begin!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter this, we had 4 lightning presentations from ETH DAM chain signatures bounty winners: \\\\\\\\nFeedback. A privacy-preserving B2C survey platform that creates a NEAR account from a participant\\\\\\\\\\\\'s phone number, used to derive an Ethereum Account and submit a cross-chain private vote. Feedback has amazing integration with survey phone calls and blockchain and great potential.\\\\\\\\n2FA. A two-factor authentication multi-sig wallet that allows one to send tokens and mint NFTs on multiple networks. 2FA has a great UX, an exciting implementation of chain signatures and a proper use case.\\\\\\\\nSecured Jamon. An atomic bridge-less cross-chain assets swap that has great use of chain signatures and complex development flow to overcome.\\\\\\\\nNevo. Private cross-chain voting with chain signatures and MACI. A very interesting use of chain signatures and good interaction between two different protocols\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese calls are set to be scheduled every month! In the meantime, we are continuing the chain abstraction discussion in the Telegram channel https://t.me/+RXYjlPob_XM5N2Ex \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more about chain abstraction -> https://linktr.ee/chainsignatures \\\\\\\\nKeep updated with the NEAR developer ecosystem -> https://newsletter.neardevhub.org/ \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Watch the recap [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RSt7vPR-yM)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"undefined\", \"title\": \"Chain Abstraction Community Calls #1\", \"author\": \"victorkanu1.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"news\", \"subtitle\": \"\", \"createdAt\": \"2024-05-01\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-05-01\", \"description\": \"\", \"publishedAt\": \"2024-05-01\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"chain-abstraction\"}"

While the merkletree crate is a powerful tool for constructing them, they do not implement serialization methods or functions. So, let\\\\\\\\u{2019}s take a deeper look into the significance of serialization and how it impacts how these data structures are stored and utilized within smart contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Serialization in Rust Smart Contracts\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nWhen working with Merkle trees in Rust, how the tree nodes are serialized can profoundly affect the efficiency and security of the smart contract. Serialization involves converting the in-memory representation of the Merkle tree into a format that can be stored, transmitted, or hashed. The choice of serialization format and the specific implementation details can significantly influence the size of the data, the speed of serialization and deserialization processes, and the overall performance of the smart contract.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the near_sdk\\\\\\\\u{2019}s near macro supports serialization (and deserialization) with borsh and serde,  it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s crucial to understand the implications of this abstraction. By relying solely on the derived implementations, developers may overlook the opportunity to optimize based on the specific requirements of their smart contract, where custom serialization logic may sometimes be necessary to achieve better performance, reduce storage costs, or ensure compatibility with external systems. This understanding empowers developers to decide on the best project serialization strategy.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Custom vs. Standard\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nUsing libraries like serde and borsh for serialization in Rust provides a standardized, flexible approach with support for various formats and a suite of advanced features, which can streamline integration and reduce boilerplate code. However, the convenience of these general-purpose libraries can come with trade-offs, including potential performance and binary size overhead. These drawbacks might be critical in resource-constrained or high-throughput environments, and developers must know them to make the right project choices.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustom serialization can be a game-changer. By implementing serialization logic tailored to the data structure, developers can optimize for performance and gain fine-grained control over the process. In the case of a Merkle tree, a custom serialization function can be remarkably efficient. By bypassing the overhead of a generic library, custom serialization can outperform existing libraries in terms of speed and memory usage. However, this approach also increases the developer\\\\\\\\\\\\'s responsibility for the code\\\\\\\\\\\\'s correctness and security, as it lacks the reliability of libraries like serde or borsh. While offering flexibility for specific use cases, custom serialization can complicate maintainability and adaptability, potentially increasing the codebase\\\\\\\\\\\\'s complexity and effort required for future modifications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the following section of this article, we will explore custom serialization. By examining the code and discussing some of the trade-offs, we aim to help developers decide if and when this approach is a better option, empowering them to make informed decisions based on their specific project requirements and constraints.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Compressing NFTs with a Merkle Tree\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nMerkle trees have emerged as a powerful data structure in smart contracts, offering a novel approach to data compression and efficient state management. By leveraging the inherent properties of Merkle trees, smart contracts can significantly reduce storage requirements and optimize data verification processes. To illustrate this concept, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s explore a smart contract that compresses NFT data to minimize gas costs during minting.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**For this example, we wrote the CompressedDataContract smart contract:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- Utilizes the NEAR protocol\\\\\\\\\\\\'s SDK and leverages the merkletree crate to construct and manage the Merkle tree \\\\\\\\n- Employs the sha2 crate for hashing purposes. \\\\\\\\n- A custom `Sha256Digest hasher` ensures compatibility with the Merkle tree implementation. \\\\\\\\n- The contract also provides essential functionality for creating new instances, updating and verifying the Merkle root, and performing data-related operations. \\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**The contract implements serialization and deserialization methods to facilitate the storage and transmission of the Merkle tree data:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- Serialization takes the Merkle tree data and converts it into a compact binary format suitable for storage. \\\\\\\\n- Deserialization reverses the process, taking the serialized binary data and reconstructing the Merkle tree structure in memory.\\\\\\\\n- They are optimized for the specific requirements of the Merkle tree data structure, and consider the characteristics of the Merkle tree, such as the fixed-size hashes and the tree\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hierarchical structure, to ensure efficient storage and retrieval operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUltimately, the objective is to significantly reduce storage costs and gas consumption using custom serialization techniques. We want the compact binary representation of the Merkle tree data to minimize the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain, resulting in lower storage fees.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s take a closer look at a custom serialization method for merkle trees in Rust:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n```rust\\\\\\\\npub fn serialize_merkle_tree_data(&self) -> Vec<u8> {\\\\\\\\n    let mut serialized_data = vec![0u8; 32 * self.merkle_tree_data.len()];\\\\\\\\n    let mut start = 0;\\\\\\\\n    let mut end = 32;\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    for element in &self.merkle_tree_data {\\\\\\\\n        serialized_data[start..end].copy_from_slice(element);\\\\\\\\n        start += 32;\\\\\\\\n        end += 32;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    serialized_data\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we have a `serialize_merkle_tree_data` method that takes a reference to `self` and returns a `Vec<u8>` representing the serialized Merkle tree data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe method begins by creating a mutable vector called `serialized_data` with a length equal to 32 times the number of elements in `self.merkle_tree_data`. This ensures that the serialized data will have enough capacity to store all the elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, we initialize two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the current range within serialized_data, where each element will be copied.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe iterate over each `element` in `self.merkle_tree_data` using a for loop. We use the `copy_from_slice` method for each element to copy its bytes into the corresponding range of `serialized_data`, specified by `start..end`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter copying each `element`, we increment `start` and `end` by 32 to move to the next range in serialized_data for the subsequent element.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Finally, we return the `serialized_data` vector containing the serialized Merkle tree data.**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nAs we can see, this custom serialization approach has several advantages:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Performance:** By directly copying the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, we avoid the overhead of generic serialization libraries, resulting in faster serialization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo quantify the performance benefits, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s consider an example scenario. Suppose we have a Merkle tree with 1,000,000 elements, where each element is a 32-byte hash. Using custom serialization, we can directly copy the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, resulting in a serialized output size of exactly 32,000,000 bytes (32 MB). On the other hand, if we used a generic serialization library like borsh, there would be additional overhead. Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector and may include other metadata. \\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s consider a typical NFT data structure to estimate overhead and analyze the potential overhead introduced by borsh serialization.**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nExample NFT Data Structure:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```rust\\\\\\\\nuse borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]\\\\\\\\npub struct NFT {\\\\\\\\n    pub id: u64,\\\\\\\\n    pub owner: String,\\\\\\\\n    pub metadata: String,\\\\\\\\n    pub approved_accounts: Vec<String>,\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the NFT struct contains the following fields:\\\\\\\\n- id: a unique identifier of type u64.\\\\\\\\n- owner: a string representing the owner of the NFT.\\\\\\\\n- metadata: a string containing metadata associated with the NFT.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: a vector of strings representing the approved accounts for the NFT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Borsh Serialization Overhead\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nWhen serializing the NFT struct using borsh, the following overhead is introduced:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Field Type Information:**\\\\\\\\n- id: Borsh uses 8 bytes to represent a u64 value.\\\\\\\\n- owner and metadata: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to each string to indicate the length of the string.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector to indicate the number of elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Field Values:**\\\\\\\\n- id: The actual value of the id field is serialized as is, without additional overhead.\\\\\\\\n- owner and metadata: The string contents are serialized after the length prefix.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: Each string in the vector is serialized with its 4-byte length prefix followed by the string contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Assuming the following values for the NFT struct:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 42\\\\\\\\n- owner: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0x1234567890\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (12 bytes)\\\\\\\\n- metadata: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Example NFT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is an example NFT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (64 bytes)\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0xabcdef1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0x9876543210\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] (2 elements, 12 bytes each)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The serialized output using borsh would consist of the following:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 8 bytes\\\\\\\\n- owner: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents) = 16 bytes\\\\\\\\n- metadata: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 64 bytes (string contents) = 68 bytes\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 2 * (4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents)) = 36 bytes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe total serialized size using borsh would be 8 + 16 + 68 + 36 = 128 bytes.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Custom Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nIf we implement custom serialization for the NFT struct, we could reduce the overhead by eliminating the need for length prefixes and field type information. The custom serialization would only serialize the actual field values without additional metadata.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Using custom serialization, the serialized size would be:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 8 bytes\\\\\\\\n- owner: 12 bytes\\\\\\\\n- metadata: 64 bytes\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: 2 * 12 bytes = 24 bytes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe total serialized size using custom serialization is 8 + 12 + 64 + 24 = 108 bytes.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**In this example, the overhead introduced by borsh serialization is approximately:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(128 bytes - 108 bytes) / 108 bytes * 100% \\\\\\\\u{2248} 18.5%\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, custom serialization could reduce the serialized size by around 18.5% compared to borsh serialization for this specific NFT data structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to note that the actual overhead may vary depending on the specific data structure, the size of the field values, and any additional optimizations the serialization library applies. The example is a simplified representation and may only reflect the exact overhead in some scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Simplicity:** The code is straightforward to understand, making it maintainable and less prone to bugs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Control:** We have complete control over the serialization process, allowing us to optimize it for our specific use case and data structure.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**However, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to note that custom serialization also comes with some trade-offs:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**1. Lack of flexibility:** The custom serialization method is tailored to the Merkle tree data structure and may not easily adapt to other data types or formats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Maintenance:** As the codebase evolves, maintaining custom serialization logic across multiple components can become challenging and may lead to duplication of effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Interoperability:** Custom serialization formats may not be compatible with other systems or libraries, limiting interoperability.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### A quick note about the Merkle Tree implementation\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nThe contract showcases the dynamic nature of Merkle trees within smart contract operations. The `get_merkle_tree` method constructs a Merkle tree on-the-fly based on the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s underlying data, while the `update_merkle_tree` and `update_merkle_tree_after_mint` methods play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the Merkle tree.  Finally, by leveraging Merkle proofs, the contract can verify the inclusion of specific data elements within the Merkle tree without retrieving and processing the entire dataset. This optimization significantly reduces the computational overhead associated with data verification, enhancing the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s performance and scalability. \\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Decisions\\\\\\\\u{2026}\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nCustom serialization can provide a fast and efficient solution in scenarios where performance is critical, and the data structure is simple, like Merkle trees. However, a well-established serialization library like `borsch` and `serde` may be better for more complex data structures or when interoperability is a priority. Here are some ideas about when it is more convenient to opt for custom or standard serialization:\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Custom Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- When building systems that require ultra-fast data processing, such as real-time trading platforms.\\\\\\\\n- Minimizing binary size is crucial in embedded systems or IoT devices where resources are limited.\\\\\\\\n- In security-sensitive applications, precise control over data handling is required to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.\\\\\\\\n- When serialization and deserialization speed are critical, such as in high-frequency data logging applications.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Standard Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- In applications requiring support for multiple data formats and the ability to easily switch between them without significant code changes.\\\\\\\\n- When developing software that must be interoperable with other systems that use standard serialization formats.\\\\\\\\n- For projects that benefit from the community support, documentation, and updates established libraries like Serde and Borsch offer.\\\\\\\\n- A robust error-handling mechanism is essential in complex systems with highly variable data structures.\\\\\\\\n- When ease of use and reduced development time are prioritized over absolute performance optimization.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nUltimately, the decision depends on your project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s specific requirements and constraints. By understanding the trade-offs and choosing the appropriate serialization approach, you can ensure that your Rust code is efficient, maintainable, and suited to your needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI hope you enjoyed the article.

We want the compact binary representation of the Merkle tree data to minimize the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain, resulting in lower storage fees.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s take a closer look at a custom serialization method for merkle trees in Rust:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n```rust\\\\\\\\npub fn serialize_merkle_tree_data(&self) -> Vec<u8> {\\\\\\\\n    let mut serialized_data = vec![0u8; 32 * self.merkle_tree_data.len()];\\\\\\\\n    let mut start = 0;\\\\\\\\n    let mut end = 32;\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    for element in &self.merkle_tree_data {\\\\\\\\n        serialized_data[start..end].copy_from_slice(element);\\\\\\\\n        start += 32;\\\\\\\\n        end += 32;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    serialized_data\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we have a `serialize_merkle_tree_data` method that takes a reference to `self` and returns a `Vec<u8>` representing the serialized Merkle tree data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe method begins by creating a mutable vector called `serialized_data` with a length equal to 32 times the number of elements in `self.merkle_tree_data`. This ensures that the serialized data will have enough capacity to store all the elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, we initialize two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the current range within serialized_data, where each element will be copied.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe iterate over each `element` in `self.merkle_tree_data` using a for loop. We use the `copy_from_slice` method for each element to copy its bytes into the corresponding range of `serialized_data`, specified by `start..end`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter copying each `element`, we increment `start` and `end` by 32 to move to the next range in serialized_data for the subsequent element.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Finally, we return the `serialized_data` vector containing the serialized Merkle tree data.**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nAs we can see, this custom serialization approach has several advantages:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Performance:** By directly copying the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, we avoid the overhead of generic serialization libraries, resulting in faster serialization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo quantify the performance benefits, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s consider an example scenario. Suppose we have a Merkle tree with 1,000,000 elements, where each element is a 32-byte hash. Using custom serialization, we can directly copy the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, resulting in a serialized output size of exactly 32,000,000 bytes (32 MB). On the other hand, if we used a generic serialization library like borsh, there would be additional overhead. Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector and may include other metadata. \\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s consider a typical NFT data structure to estimate overhead and analyze the potential overhead introduced by borsh serialization.**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nExample NFT Data Structure:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```rust\\\\\\\\nuse borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]\\\\\\\\npub struct NFT {\\\\\\\\n    pub id: u64,\\\\\\\\n    pub owner: String,\\\\\\\\n    pub metadata: String,\\\\\\\\n    pub approved_accounts: Vec<String>,\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the NFT struct contains the following fields:\\\\\\\\n- id: a unique identifier of type u64.\\\\\\\\n- owner: a string representing the owner of the NFT.\\\\\\\\n- metadata: a string containing metadata associated with the NFT.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: a vector of strings representing the approved accounts for the NFT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Borsh Serialization Overhead\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nWhen serializing the NFT struct using borsh, the following overhead is introduced:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Field Type Information:**\\\\\\\\n- id: Borsh uses 8 bytes to represent a u64 value.\\\\\\\\n- owner and metadata: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to each string to indicate the length of the string.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector to indicate the number of elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Field Values:**\\\\\\\\n- id: The actual value of the id field is serialized as is, without additional overhead.\\\\\\\\n- owner and metadata: The string contents are serialized after the length prefix.\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: Each string in the vector is serialized with its 4-byte length prefix followed by the string contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Assuming the following values for the NFT struct:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 42\\\\\\\\n- owner: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0x1234567890\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (12 bytes)\\\\\\\\n- metadata: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Example NFT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is an example NFT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (64 bytes)\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0xabcdef1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0x9876543210\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] (2 elements, 12 bytes each)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The serialized output using borsh would consist of the following:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 8 bytes\\\\\\\\n- owner: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents) = 16 bytes\\\\\\\\n- metadata: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 64 bytes (string contents) = 68 bytes\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 2 * (4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents)) = 36 bytes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe total serialized size using borsh would be 8 + 16 + 68 + 36 = 128 bytes.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Custom Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nIf we implement custom serialization for the NFT struct, we could reduce the overhead by eliminating the need for length prefixes and field type information. The custom serialization would only serialize the actual field values without additional metadata.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Using custom serialization, the serialized size would be:**\\\\\\\\n- id: 8 bytes\\\\\\\\n- owner: 12 bytes\\\\\\\\n- metadata: 64 bytes\\\\\\\\n- approved_accounts: 2 * 12 bytes = 24 bytes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe total serialized size using custom serialization is 8 + 12 + 64 + 24 = 108 bytes.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**In this example, the overhead introduced by borsh serialization is approximately:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(128 bytes - 108 bytes) / 108 bytes * 100% \\\\\\\\u{2248} 18.5%\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, custom serialization could reduce the serialized size by around 18.5% compared to borsh serialization for this specific NFT data structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to note that the actual overhead may vary depending on the specific data structure, the size of the field values, and any additional optimizations the serialization library applies. The example is a simplified representation and may only reflect the exact overhead in some scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Simplicity:** The code is straightforward to understand, making it maintainable and less prone to bugs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Control:** We have complete control over the serialization process, allowing us to optimize it for our specific use case and data structure.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**However, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to note that custom serialization also comes with some trade-offs:**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n**1. Lack of flexibility:** The custom serialization method is tailored to the Merkle tree data structure and may not easily adapt to other data types or formats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Maintenance:** As the codebase evolves, maintaining custom serialization logic across multiple components can become challenging and may lead to duplication of effort.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Interoperability:** Custom serialization formats may not be compatible with other systems or libraries, limiting interoperability.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### A quick note about the Merkle Tree implementation\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nThe contract showcases the dynamic nature of Merkle trees within smart contract operations. The `get_merkle_tree` method constructs a Merkle tree on-the-fly based on the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s underlying data, while the `update_merkle_tree` and `update_merkle_tree_after_mint` methods play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the Merkle tree.  Finally, by leveraging Merkle proofs, the contract can verify the inclusion of specific data elements within the Merkle tree without retrieving and processing the entire dataset. This optimization significantly reduces the computational overhead associated with data verification, enhancing the contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s performance and scalability. \\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Decisions\\\\\\\\u{2026}\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nCustom serialization can provide a fast and efficient solution in scenarios where performance is critical, and the data structure is simple, like Merkle trees. However, a well-established serialization library like `borsch` and `serde` may be better for more complex data structures or when interoperability is a priority. Here are some ideas about when it is more convenient to opt for custom or standard serialization:\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Custom Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- When building systems that require ultra-fast data processing, such as real-time trading platforms.\\\\\\\\n- Minimizing binary size is crucial in embedded systems or IoT devices where resources are limited.\\\\\\\\n- In security-sensitive applications, precise control over data handling is required to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.\\\\\\\\n- When serialization and deserialization speed are critical, such as in high-frequency data logging applications.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### Standard Serialization\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n- In applications requiring support for multiple data formats and the ability to easily switch between them without significant code changes.\\\\\\\\n- When developing software that must be interoperable with other systems that use standard serialization formats.\\\\\\\\n- For projects that benefit from the community support, documentation, and updates established libraries like Serde and Borsch offer.\\\\\\\\n- A robust error-handling mechanism is essential in complex systems with highly variable data structures.\\\\\\\\n- When ease of use and reduced development time are prioritized over absolute performance optimization.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\nUltimately, the decision depends on your project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s specific requirements and constraints. By understanding the trade-offs and choosing the appropriate serialization approach, you can ensure that your Rust code is efficient, maintainable, and suited to your needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI hope you enjoyed the article.

To stay updated on cutting edge tech, be sure to check out the rest of our [whiteboard series](https://www.youtube.com/@NEARProtocol/search?query=whiteboard)!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- We received positive feedback on community tools\\\\\\\\\\\\' functionality and smooth operation. Efte, a member of our tools community shares thoughts: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yea I am pretty happy with tooling by now, Everything works smooth and I like it a lot.\\\\\\\\nWould be happy to work together with somebody to create FT, NFT and / or cross contract call walkthroughs and youtube videos even\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- There\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been discussions on the possibility of re-deploying contracts from JavaScript to Rust while preserving state. It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible, but you will need to make sure that your Rust version can read the serialized data stored in the state. You can use `near.cli.rs` to view your contract storage to make that decision: `near contract view-storage`. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **DevHub** announces a significant upgrade to DevHub that revolutionizes the funding journey. Detailed information about the revamped proposal submission and funding process aligned with DevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mission can be found \\\\\\\\u{1f449} [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=3251).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Discussion on renaming `near-cli-rs` to reduce confusion in the ecosystem, suggesting `inear` (Interactive NEAR) as an alternative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Confirmation that contracts can be annotated using either the verbose 5.0.0 way or the concise 5.1+ way, providing flexibility and backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consideration of handling annotations in documentation, particularly the transition from `#[near_bindgen]` to `#[near]`, is discussed because there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a shift in the SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\'s approach to contract annotations. With the release of SDK 5.1+, the #[near] annotation is introduced as a more concise alternative to #[near_bindgen]. This transition is significant for developers as it affects how they annotate their contracts and interact with the NEAR ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy adopting #[near], developers can reduce the boilerplate code and make their contracts more concise, enhancing readability and maintainability. There\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also a discussion on the importance of handling contract annotations in the documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-  Interest expressed in FastAuth, an authentication mechanism for NEAR Protocol, aimed at simplifying onboarding and account recovery. You can find more information about FastAuth here: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} [NEAR Wiki](https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} [NEAR blog](https://pages.near.org/blog/fastauth-sdk-beta-now-available/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also mentioned that FastAuth should work on testnet, and while there might not be extensive example implementations readily available, contributions to improve documentation and examples are welcome. [Documentation Community](https://t.me/neardocscg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Users encounter errors while attempting to create accounts on NEAR testnet. The issue appears to stem from account creation scripts lacking necessary private key configurations. Community members provide troubleshooting advice and code snippets to resolve the issue. [Link to discussions](https://t.me/neardev/41846)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- A recent change in the NEAR RPC API caused disruptions for some applications, prompting concerns about backward compatibility and proper deprecation warnings. However, the change has since been reverted to address the issue and ensure continuity for developers relying on the NEAR RPC API. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Stay updated with the NEAR Validator upgrade: [NEAR Validator Update](https://pages.near.org/blog/an-update-on-the-near-validator-upgrade/?ssp=1&setlang=en&cc=AT&safesearch=moderate).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-  Ecosystem Developers explore methods for updating contract metadata and ensuring changes propagate to indexers.

Release expected in the next couple of days.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Developers are exploring the implementation of a broadcast_tx_async-based wallet to enhance user experience within the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `New Documentation`: Discover how your NEAR account can control accounts on other chains, such as Ethereum, through Chain Signatures. Learn more in our new articles:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449}[What are Chain Signatures?](https://docs.near.org/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449}[Create a Chain Signature](https://docs.near.org/abstraction/chain-signatures)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Chain Abstraction, What is it? Learn about it \\\\\\\\u{1f449} [here](https://twitter.com/NEARDevHub/status/1772615619168403619).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Learn about Chain Abstractions goals \\\\\\\\u{1f449} [here](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1770890267018535308).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Community members compare gas costs between contracts compiled from JavaScript SDK and contracts compiled from Rust to WASM, revealing significant differences in gas consumption.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} Rust based WASM: [Transaction Link](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/J8MiLqghiWxRWhogsZSRVYYaJx4WRbAKcUuM1xMDu5fJ#)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} JS based WASM: [Transaction Link](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/25MufUqsgeuQAJ9EZXKdSgrjuCmMHHFyMtNKx1i9Fe9q#)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReason: Rust\\\\\\\\\\\\'s strong typing and memory safety features can lead to more robust and secure contracts, but they also introduce additional overhead in terms of gas costs due to the need for stricter memory management and error handling mechanisms. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Check out this deep dive into [Lava Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-16v_h0s5s). To stay updated on cutting edge tech, be sure to check out the rest of our [whiteboard series](https://www.youtube.com/@NEARProtocol/search?query=whiteboard)!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- We received positive feedback on community tools\\\\\\\\\\\\' functionality and smooth operation. Efte, a member of our tools community shares thoughts: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yea I am pretty happy with tooling by now, Everything works smooth and I like it a lot.\\\\\\\\nWould be happy to work together with somebody to create FT, NFT and / or cross contract call walkthroughs and youtube videos even\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- There\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been discussions on the possibility of re-deploying contracts from JavaScript to Rust while preserving state. It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible, but you will need to make sure that your Rust version can read the serialized data stored in the state. You can use `near.cli.rs` to view your contract storage to make that decision: `near contract view-storage`. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **DevHub** announces a significant upgrade to DevHub that revolutionizes the funding journey. Detailed information about the revamped proposal submission and funding process aligned with DevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mission can be found \\\\\\\\u{1f449} [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=3251).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Discussion on renaming `near-cli-rs` to reduce confusion in the ecosystem, suggesting `inear` (Interactive NEAR) as an alternative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Confirmation that contracts can be annotated using either the verbose 5.0.0 way or the concise 5.1+ way, providing flexibility and backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consideration of handling annotations in documentation, particularly the transition from `#[near_bindgen]` to `#[near]`, is discussed because there\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a shift in the SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\'s approach to contract annotations. With the release of SDK 5.1+, the #[near] annotation is introduced as a more concise alternative to #[near_bindgen]. This transition is significant for developers as it affects how they annotate their contracts and interact with the NEAR ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy adopting #[near], developers can reduce the boilerplate code and make their contracts more concise, enhancing readability and maintainability. There\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also a discussion on the importance of handling contract annotations in the documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-  Interest expressed in FastAuth, an authentication mechanism for NEAR Protocol, aimed at simplifying onboarding and account recovery. You can find more information about FastAuth here: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} [NEAR Wiki](https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{1f449} [NEAR blog](https://pages.near.org/blog/fastauth-sdk-beta-now-available/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also mentioned that FastAuth should work on testnet, and while there might not be extensive example implementations readily available, contributions to improve documentation and examples are welcome. [Documentation Community](https://t.me/neardocscg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Users encounter errors while attempting to create accounts on NEAR testnet. The issue appears to stem from account creation scripts lacking necessary private key configurations. Community members provide troubleshooting advice and code snippets to resolve the issue. [Link to discussions](https://t.me/neardev/41846)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- A recent change in the NEAR RPC API caused disruptions for some applications, prompting concerns about backward compatibility and proper deprecation warnings. However, the change has since been reverted to address the issue and ensure continuity for developers relying on the NEAR RPC API. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Stay updated with the NEAR Validator upgrade: [NEAR Validator Update](https://pages.near.org/blog/an-update-on-the-near-validator-upgrade/?ssp=1&setlang=en&cc=AT&safesearch=moderate).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-  Ecosystem Developers explore methods for updating contract metadata and ensuring changes propagate to indexers. [Join Tools Community](https://t.me/NEAR_Tools_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Community members discuss NEAR Protocol contract addresses and share pull requests for fixing issues in NEAR Lake Indexer.

Join us as we explore how AI is integrating with NEAR and empowering users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### FEATURED RELEASES & PR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\u{1f929}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u{1f389} **`create-near-app v7.0.0`** has been released \\\\\\\\u{1f389}:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis new version makes it optional to use NEAR components (aka BOS Components) when creating a Web Application. Another change is that now all pages leverage a React Context to share a common wallet as well as the AccountId when a user is logged-in. Please try it and let us know if anything is not working as expected [here](https://github.com/near/create-near-app)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New release of `near-sdk-contract-tools`, now supports `near-sdk@5.1`. You can find more information about the release \\\\\\\\u{1f449}[here](https://twitter.com/sudo_build/status/1788176556277616884).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **`near-jsonrpc-client-rs`** Version 0.9.0 has been released:\\\\\\\\n   - A new release of `near-jsonrpc-client-rs` version 0.9.0 was announced. This release includes improvements to the RPC server in nearcore. The update was credited to a specific contributor and was accompanied by gratitude for testing and final tweaks before release.\\\\\\\\n   - Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/releases/tag/0.9.0)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u{1f680} [**`near.cli.rs`**](https://near.cli.rs/) has new releases [0.9.0](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/tag/v0.9.0) and [0.9.1](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/tag/v0.9.1)\\\\\\\\nEnjoy even more help from CLI selecting the functions to interact if the contract supports NEAR ABI!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Discover more in releases and merged pull requests in our **changelog** \\\\\\\\u{1f449} [here](https://docs.near.org/changelog/2024/02/29/#-documentation).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\n### DEVELOPER UPDATES \\\\\\\\u{1f6e0}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **\\\\\\\\u{1f929} AI Integration on NEAR \\\\\\\\u{1f929}**: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday, NEAR announced the initiative to make NEAR the home for User-Owned AI. Led by top experts in the field, NEAR Foundation commits to incubating and investing in NEAR-based AI infrastructure projects. This includes compute and inference, data curation and rewarding creators, crowdsourcing, synthetic data marketplaces, agentic infrastructure, and more. Any AI application and novel consumer use case can leverage NEAR for the best User-Owned AI infrastructure and access everyone in Web3 via Chain Abstraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[@near_ai](https://x.com/near_ai) AI R&D lab has been established , led by [@AlexSkidanov](https://x.com/AlexSkidanov)and , focusing on building an AI Developer to allow anyone to build end-to-end Web3 applications without code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NEAR is the best place to build and incubate the next generation of AI projects.** NEAR Foundation, as a well-resourced not-for-profit with strong expertise in both AI and Web3, is positioned to drive a User-Owned AI movement that offers alternatives to closed, centralized players and succeeds at a global scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **NEAR Smart Contract Versioning and Upgrades**:\\\\\\\\n   - On NEAR, unlike EVM, you can overwrite the same contract address. End users can compile the contract and confirm the hash themselves. Once development stabilizes, you can remove all \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"full access keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to make the contract immutable. Developers are discussing the process of versioning and upgrading smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain. \\\\\\\\n   - Relevant link: [NEAR Rust SDK Contract Structure](https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/contract-structure/nesting#error-prone-patterns)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Efficient Batch Transactions in NEAR**:\\\\\\\\n   - Developers are exploring how to handle partial failures in batch transactions and the implications for transaction outcomes. When sending batch transactions, if one action fails, the entire transaction reverts. This is different from some blockchain systems where partial failures are allowed.\\\\\\\\n   - Example code and error handling details are discussed in: [NEAR API JS Cookbook](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/master/packages/cookbook/transactions/batch-transactions.js)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Updating NEAR Contracts Frequently**:\\\\\\\\n   - Consider using a hook mechanism on another frequently called contract to trigger updates. Ensure efficient cross-contract calls for reliability.\\\\\\\\n   - More information: [NEAR SDK](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/naj-quick-reference)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **Managing Access Keys and Nonce Collisions**:\\\\\\\\n   - Developers are exploring methods to handle nonce collisions when using multiple access keys in high-velocity transaction systems. This involves creating and managing access keys dynamically to avoid conflicts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Implicit Accounts and Access Keys**:\\\\\\\\n   - Implicit accounts can be managed like regular accounts post-creation, including adding and revoking access keys.\\\\\\\\n   - Check out this discussion: [Twitter thread](https://x.com/ekuzyakov/status/1684786243232800768?s=46)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. **Cross-Contract Calls Best Practices**:\\\\\\\\n   - Efficient implementation of cross-contract calls ensures reliability. Look into using promises and avoiding state confusion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. **Integrating Wallet Connection Features**:\\\\\\\\n    - Implementing wallet connection using near-wallet-selector. Ensure automatic linking of wallet information across devices.\\\\\\\\n    - Helpful resource: [NEAR Wallet Selector GitHub](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-selector)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. **NEAR Contract State Management**:\\\\\\\\n    -  Developers are sharing insights into effective state management in NEAR contracts, particularly focusing on Rust enums and macros to handle state migrations efficiently.\\\\\\\\n    - Detailed guide: [NEAR Rust SDK Contract Structure](https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/contract-structure/nesting#error-prone-patterns)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. **Token Metadata Updates in NEAR**:\\\\\\\\n    - After updating token contracts, ensure the changes reflect correctly on explorers and wallets. This might require notifying indexers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. **Testing NEAR Contracts with State Forking**:\\\\\\\\n    - For context setting in tests, use integration testing libraries to copy the state of specific contracts.\\\\\\\\n    - Testing library: [NEAR Workspaces RS](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. **Security in High-Velocity Systems**:\\\\\\\\n    - Employ strategies like creating multiple full access keys to manage nonce collisions in high-velocity transaction systems.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n13. **Implicit Accounts Creation Constraints**:\\\\\\\\n    - Implicit accounts can only bind the associated public key when created, ensuring security against unauthorized control.\\\\\\\\n    - Example scenarios: (Chat excerpts on implicit account creation and security)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14. **Pagoda**:\\\\\\\\n    - Pagoda is going through a Privacy Assessment exercise with an external company. This officially kicked off last week and will be going until July. The goal is to help better support users with their privacy rights/needs but also identify and manage potential  privacy risks. We are following the NIST Privacy Framework in that respect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n15. **Pagoda**:\\\\\\\\n    - Pagoda is kicking off audits for Chain Signatures and the Multichain Gas Relayer. This is something that will be completed prior to the products launching on mainnet.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n16. **UI Near Component Library Announcement**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Community member announced the availability of the UI Near component library, shared a link for feedback, and discussed Tailwind usage. The shared link was: [UI is Near](https://www.uiisnear.xyz/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n17. **New Documentation feature:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCode Navigator was released on docs \\\\\\\\u{1f6a8}\\\\\\\\u{1f389}, A new tool in docs that\\\\\\\\\\\\'s able to better explain code-related concepts! Please check it and give us feedback so we can improve it!
