Its purpose is to expand the protocol\\\\\\\\\\\\'s user base by providing accessible knowledge. This certification targets individuals already engaged or interested in Web 3.0, including developers, architects, technology specialists, and operations personnel. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for students, entrepreneurs, project initiators, project managers, and early adopters seeking a foundational understanding of Web 3.0 software and the NEAR protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Where is NEAR Elementals located in the learning path?** NEAR Elementals is located just at the beginning of our journey in the NEAR World. Like any new emergent technology there are many new concepts and elements which are being developed for it, NEAR Elementals gives an understanding of those concepts even for those people who are experienced in other technological fields. Unlike other more advanced NEAR certifications which are going deep into the programming of the solutions, NEAR Elementals is looking to settle the bases on each future NEAR developer about what we are trying to achieve with the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHolders of the NEAR Elementals Certificate will bolster the skill sets necessary for advancing to higher-level NEAR certifications. \\\\\\\\u{1f53c}This progression is integral to driving widespread adoption among end users within the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\u{1f53c}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## BOS Certified Developer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**BOS Certified Developer** is a 5-day virtual educational program that teaches developers inside and outside the NEAR ecosystem to develop highly decentralized interfaces with widgets deployed on the NEAR Protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach developer who completes the BCD has the ability to develop and manage BOS components, as well as connect chains/layer 2 of Ethereum (EVM), this is achieved thanks to the curricular design and the pedagogical vision that each of the instructors supports the participants.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## NEAR Certified Developer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NEAR Certified Developer (NCD) bootcamp**, is a 5-day virtual educational program that teaches internal and external developers in the NEAR ecosystem how to develop smart contracts with Rust and Javascript for the NEAR Protocol\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach developer who completes the NCD has the ability to develop and deploy high-quality smart contracts, adhering to good programming practices and respecting NEAR contract standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[NEAR Education Path](https://i.ibb.co/hW00xJb/NEAR-Education-Path.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### OpenEdx LMS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen edX is an open-source Learning Management System designed for online education. It provides flexibility, global accessibility, advanced assessment tools, scalability, and an engaged community. It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cost-effective and allows for course customization to meet participants\\\\\\\\\\\\' needs. Implementing this aims to create a platform dedicated to participant tracking, assessment management, and content curation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Partnership with Educational Department\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, the Open Web Academy team will achieve a Partnership with the Department of Education of Nayarit Mexico to promote and teach certifications here in favor of professors and university students.
