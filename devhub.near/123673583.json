In pursuit of this goal tests for other `store` collections must be introduced, showcasing basic operations on big number of elements. Additionally `Lazy` is going to receive a method that allows for explicit storage removal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Background\\\\\\\\n`LazyOption` and `TreeMap` collections are still under unstable feature-flag. `LazyOption` lacks integration testing to determine if it indeed upholds the assumptions in terms of storage I/O. `TreeMap` used to have really poor iteration performance, which is still the case compared to other collections. Therefore it has been decided to test how this collection behaves when holding a large number of elements. \\\\\\\\nThere has also been a request for the ability to drop `Lazy` storage for easier contract migrations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Relevant reading:\\\\\\\\n### TreeMap\\\\\\\\n1. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/818#issuecomment-1252681346\\\\\\\\n2. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/pull/964\\\\\\\\n3. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/928\\\\\\\\n4. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/1199\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### LazyOption\\\\\\\\n1. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/1199\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Lazy\\\\\\\\n1. https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/1218\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Deliverables\\\\\\\\n1. Cover applicable `store` collections with tests showcasing basic operations, while holding ~100k elements.\\\\\\\\n2. Cover `LazyOption` with integration tests showcasing assumptions about it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s storage usage patterns. Either confirm those assumptions or fix and move out of `unstable`.\\\\\\\\n3. Implement a `remove` method for `Lazy` values and test that.\\\\\\\\n4. Either confirm that `TreeMap` is usable via action item `1` and move it out of unstable or identify further steps for performance improvement.
