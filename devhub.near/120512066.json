Picture it as a high-tech crystal ball, offering a transparent view of all the activities happening on the NEAR blockchain. From transactions and accounts to contracts and changes in state, this explorer lets you peek into the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s soul without performing any dark magic. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s user-friendly, accessible, and doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t require chanting in binary.\\\\\\\\nKey Definitions to Keep in Your Toolkit\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Transaction:** This is the backbone of the NEAR blockchain, a record that says, \\\\\\\\u{201c}Hey, something just happened!\\\\\\\\u{201d} Whether it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s transferring NEAR tokens, calling a smart contract, or creating a new account, transactions are the lifeblood of the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s functionality.\\\\\\\\nAccount: Think of this as your digital identity on the NEAR platform. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s where your tokens live and how you interact with smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchains, NEAR accounts have human-readable names, not just a string of confusing characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Block:** A bundle of transactions processed and recorded together. Blocks are chained together (hence, blockchain) to create a secure and unalterable ledger of all transactions.\\\\\\\\nGas: No, not the kind you need to fill up your car. In NEAR, gas refers to the computational effort required to execute transactions. Think of it as the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fuel\\\\\\\\u{201d} for the blockchain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart Contract:** A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like a vending machine for transactions: input your request, and the contract automatically executes the agreed-upon outcome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Reading a Transaction: Step-by-Step\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Finding the Transaction**\\\\\\\\nStart your journey on the NEAR Protocol Explorer homepage. Here, you can search for a specific transaction by its hash (a unique identifier), or you can browse through blocks to discover recent transactions. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like being a blockchain detective, looking for clues in a digital landscape.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Analyzing the Transaction Details**\\\\\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve clicked on a transaction, you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll be greeted with a plethora of details. Here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s how to make sense of them:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Transaction Hash:** The unique identifier for this transaction. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like a fingerprint but for digital actions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Sender:** The account that initiated the transaction. Think of it as the \\\\\\\\u{201c}from\\\\\\\\u{201d} address in a digital checkbook.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Receiver:** The account receiving the transaction. This could be another user or a smart contract.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Status:** Whether the transaction succeeded, failed, or is still pending. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s version of a delivery confirmation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Timestamp:** The exact moment the transaction was processed\\\\\\\\u{2014}a digital timestamp for your blockchain activities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Gas Used:** This tells you how much computational effort was required to execute the transaction. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like the receipt for the fuel your transaction consumed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Understanding the Transaction Type**\\\\\\\\nTransactions on NEAR can be as simple as transferring tokens or as complex as deploying a smart contract. By examining the transaction details, you can understand what action was performed. Each type has nuances, but the explorer provides clear descriptions to guide you through.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Execution Details: A Closer Look\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a transaction is submitted to the NEAR blockchain, it goes through several steps:\\\\\\\\nValidation: Think of this as the entrance exam for your transaction. NEAR checks if your transaction has a valid signature (like a correct password) and if you have enough balance to pay for the transaction\\\\\\\\u{2019}s gas cost (like checking if you have enough fuel in your car).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Routing:** Your transaction then takes a trip to its designated shard. NEAR uses sharding to split the network into manageable pieces, making everything faster and more scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Execution:** This is where the magic happens. The NEAR network processes it according to what your transaction aims to do (like transferring tokens or executing a smart contract). This processing involves running the specific code of your transaction and updating the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s state to reflect the change.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe execution detail of a transaction, therefore, encompasses the steps taken by the blockchain to validate, route, and execute the transaction, including any changes made to the state and the computational resources consumed to perform these actions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Tips for the Novice NEAR Explorer Detective\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Keep It Simple:** Start with basic transactions, like transfers, to familiarize yourself with the explorer\\\\\\\\u{2019}s layout.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Use Filters:** Leverage the explorer\\\\\\\\u{2019}s filtering tools to narrow your search. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like using a magnifying glass to find the necessary clue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Explore Smart Contracts:** Be bold and dive into smart contract transactions. They offer a fascinating glimpse into the programmable side of NEAR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCongratulations! You\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve just decrypted the basics of reading and understanding transactions on the NEAR Protocol Explorer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### One More Byte: Understanding Gas\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Gas** is essentially the fuel that powers transactions on NEAR. It covers the computational efforts required to validate, route, and execute transactions. Here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a breakdown:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Purpose:** Gas limits the work needed to process transactions, protects the network from potential abuse, and ensures a fair resource allocation among users. This fee is paid to validators as a reward for processing transactions and securing the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Gas Price:** The cost of gas varies based on network demand and is set by validators. You can think of it as surge pricing in ride-sharing apps, where the cost increases with demand.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Gas Limit:** When you initiate a transaction, you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll set a maximum gas limit you\\\\\\\\u{2019}re willing to use. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a way to control your spending and avoid unexpected costs. The default is often 300 Tgas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Gas Usage and Refunds**\\\\\\\\nAfter executing your transaction, the actual gas used is tallied up. If it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s less than your limit, NEAR refunds the difference. This process makes transactions efficient and economical, as you only pay for the resources you use.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### For Users and Developers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Users should learn to adjust gas limits and prices to optimize their transaction costs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Developers need to write gas-efficient code, especially for complex operations that could guzzle up computational resources. 30% of gas fees spent on the contract execution will go to a contract\\\\\\\\u{2019}s account itself; simply using it will bring some income. Due to the cheap gas cost, this will make a significant impact only for the most popular and often-called contracts, but it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s nice to have such an option nonetheless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"undefined\", \"title\": \"Understanding Transactions on the NEAR Protocol Explorer \\\\\\\\u{1f50e}\", \"author\": \"victorkanu1.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"\", \"createdAt\": \"2024-02-16\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-02-16\", \"description\": \"\", \"publishedAt\": \"2024-02-16\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"devrel\"}"

Picture it as a high-tech crystal ball, offering a transparent view of all the activities happening on the NEAR blockchain. From transactions and accounts to contracts and changes in state, this explorer lets you peek into the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s soul without performing any dark magic. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s user-friendly, accessible, and doesn\\\\\\\\u{2019}t require chanting in binary.\\\\\\\\nKey Definitions to Keep in Your Toolkit\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Transaction:** This is the backbone of the NEAR blockchain, a record that says, \\\\\\\\u{201c}Hey, something just happened!\\\\\\\\u{201d} Whether it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s transferring NEAR tokens, calling a smart contract, or creating a new account, transactions are the lifeblood of the blockchain\\\\\\\\u{2019}s functionality.\\\\\\\\nAccount: Think of this as your digital identity on the NEAR platform. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s where your tokens live and how you interact with smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchains, NEAR accounts have human-readable names, not just a string of confusing characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Block:** A bundle of transactions processed and recorded together. Blocks are chained together (hence, blockchain) to create a secure and unalterable ledger of all transactions.\\\\\\\\nGas: No, not the kind you need to fill up your car. In NEAR, gas refers to the computational effort required to execute transactions. Think of it as the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fuel\\\\\\\\u{201d} for the blockchain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart Contract:** A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It\\\\\\\\u{2019}s like a vending machine for transactions: input your request, and the contract automatically executes the agreed-upon outcome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Reading a Transaction: Step-by-Step\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Finding the Transaction**\\\\\\\\nStart your journey on the NEAR Protocol Explorer homepage. Here, you can search for a specific transaction by its hash (a unique identifier), or you can browse through blocks to discover recent transactions.
