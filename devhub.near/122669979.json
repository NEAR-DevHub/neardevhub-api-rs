It is rather sadening with the change of direction but we do agree with the points surrounding the decision. Building Nearblocks on BOS was a very laborious exercise with a lot of fine tuning and suboptimal user experience. The lack of ability to do npm imports and double loaders we have from first loading BOS and then loaders for data. Our plan will be to keep the lite explorer built on BOS so it can continue to be hosted in a decentralised way without the need for any centralised intermediary. Due to the simplicity of the site, it is a perfect use case for BOS. However, we will transition Nearblocks back to a NextJS app which would allow us to improve the user experience issues we\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve been facing with BOS (ie. double loaders). Users would see immediate benefits on loading speeds and faster iterations of newer features.\\\\\\\\n- **Existing tasks such as contract stats, verifications.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs our data storage continues to grow in an exponential rate, we are also actively researching and testing better ways to index and store the large data requirements of the growing Near blockchain. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #5 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/5).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a reminder : \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #1 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=635) ; \\\\\\\\n- Milestone #2 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2042) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #3 can be found [here](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=2804) ;\\\\\\\\n- Milestone #4 can be found [here](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/MainPage.N.Comment.Page?accountId=frol.near&blockHeight=118848444).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #1 (month 0-3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Launch of the explorer selector on BOS ([link](https://explorer.near.org/)).\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks is now open-source ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/)).\\\\\\\\n- As well as fixing outdated bugs, re-indexing missing tokens and infrastructure upgrades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #1 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #2 (month 3-6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bulk of the work within these 3 months has been on BOS and our new infrastructure. The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\n- Nearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\n- Legacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link])(https://beta.nearblocks.io/) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near)) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link])(https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15); \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players\\\\\\\\n- Contract connect methods updated to use MNW. Wallet selector will be added to BOS version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are currently working the following points on V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Tokens:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Add SBT token support - Postponed until finalised ([link](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/504))\\\\\\\\n- Transaction execution enhancements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #2 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2). \\\\\\\\nWe are continuing our attempts to support the ecosystem where best we can, with a number of ongoing requests for additional API data endpoints being worked on for multiple use cases such as taxation, validator stats and wallet support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #3 (month 6-9)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithin this milestone we have successfully deployed nearblocks.io on BOS. With this deployment, users can enjoy a faster web experience and developers can leverage a suite of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearblocksonbos.near) - check Widgets tab) we have made available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther feature requests and improvements done within this milestone : \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Contract interactions with embedded ABI ;\\\\\\\\n- Near.social comments section on addresses, transactions and token pages;\\\\\\\\n- Wallet selector integration for contract interactions ;\\\\\\\\n- Additional API endpoints for API users (balance history) ;\\\\\\\\n- Dark mode ;\\\\\\\\n- A new way of visualising a transaction execution plan ([link](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9gQFCZZN2EzjssZkRVZBmgiYjHqfwSAgwX2D62sUhnhP?tab=execution)) ;\\\\\\\\n- FT & NFT holder count in real-time ;\\\\\\\\n- Validator explorer ([link](https://nearblocks.io/node-explorer)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #3 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/3).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #4 (month 9-12)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks schema and infrastructure was updated over the past 3 months. A number of breaking changes were forced to be introduced to the API has resulted in significant speed improvements. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis milestone we built the first decentralised explorer on Near. The lite explorer is built on BOS found [here](https://lite.nearblocks.io) (for now) and on social.near gateway allows users to check their transaction by using any of the public RPC nodes available. This offers a solution to look up the status of transactions and accounts without any dependency on a centralised indexer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Lite explorer ([lite.nearblocks.io](https://lite.nearblocks.io))\\\\\\\\n- Enhanced and tree execution plan\\\\\\\\n- Receipt summary\\\\\\\\n- Display Web3 wallet ie. metamask transactions ([example](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FH7hDFGa3hXzT8EWupRDBzEf4AwPcgpA9HoPDHhHTUAe?tab=execution))\\\\\\\\n- Dex tracking (trades indexing now)\\\\\\\\n- Initial work on aurora integration ([example](https://aurora.exploreblocks.io/))\\\\\\\\n- Spam token list ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/spam-token-list))\\\\\\\\n- Cursor pagination for API clients allowing for unlimited historical data query\\\\\\\\n- Logarithmic chart changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #4 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/4).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": []}"

This offers a solution to look up the status of transactions and accounts without any dependency on a centralised indexer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Lite explorer ([lite.nearblocks.io](https://lite.nearblocks.io))\\\\\\\\n- Enhanced and tree execution plan\\\\\\\\n- Receipt summary\\\\\\\\n- Display Web3 wallet ie. metamask transactions ([example](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FH7hDFGa3hXzT8EWupRDBzEf4AwPcgpA9HoPDHhHTUAe?tab=execution))\\\\\\\\n- Dex tracking (trades indexing now)\\\\\\\\n- Initial work on aurora integration ([example](https://aurora.exploreblocks.io/))\\\\\\\\n- Spam token list ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/spam-token-list))\\\\\\\\n- Cursor pagination for API clients allowing for unlimited historical data query\\\\\\\\n- Logarithmic chart changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #4 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/4).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
