This SDK will unlock a new design space for NEAR developers across AI, DeFi, gaming, and social applications to lead NEAR one step closer to its desired end state as the chain-abstracted hub of blockchain apps. We will make encryption a standard across NEAR.\", \"category\": \"Tooling & Infrastructure\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"REVIEW\", \"sponsor_requested_review\": false, \"reviewer_completed_attestation\": false}, \"supervisor\": null, \"description\": \"# Description\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFairblock is an encryption coprocessor that makes on-chain encryption programmable, available everywhere, and simple for developers. Fairblock\\\\\\\\u{2019}s encryption SDK will allow NEAR developers to unlock an unexplored design space of privacy-preserving applications and better equip the ecosystem to support the emergent wave of AI applications. The ultimate goal of this effort is to help NEAR become the chain-abstracted ecosystem for all applications, inclusive of AI, DeFi, gaming, social, and consumer apps. A critical element of this end-state is programmable privacy, such that users don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have to bridge away from NEAR to use privacy-preserving applications; everything that users need is readily available in NEAR developer tooling. As such, baselayer privacy is a fundamental ingredient in bringing NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s AI & chain-abstracted futures to fruition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Fairblock SDK gives NEAR developers the power to plug programmable privacy and information flow control into their applications. Specifically, this toolbox will power the following categories of applications:\\\\\\\\n- AI apps: On-chain AI applications and agents are core milestones in NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s roadmap. Users should have control over their data disclosures in NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s AI-powered future where AI agents are employed to collect, analyze, and make decisions from all available on-chain data across consumer applications.\\\\\\\\n- Machine Learning: privacy-preserving ML apps can be launched on NEAR where users\\\\\\\\u{2019} data is protected throughout the inference life cycle. Model locking is also possible, where keys can be used to permit the usage of certain inference models.\\\\\\\\n- DeFi: programmable privacy allows DeFi apps to deliver encrypted intents, sealed-bid and leaderless auctions, protected trading strategies, and bad-MEV prevention in trading through conditional decryption.\\\\\\\\n- Gaming: privacy-preservation is a key aspect of the traditional gaming experience. Encryption in NEAR gaming apps will allow users to keep their hands hidden in poker, conceal their bets, and keep their in-game actions hidden until they\\\\\\\\u{2019}re executed. Privacy is also important in on-chain gambling.\\\\\\\\n- NFTs: our encryption SDK can be used for randomness generation in NFT mints as well as sealed bid auctions in marketplaces.\\\\\\\\n- Social and consumer apps: as more and more consumer applications come on-chain, users will require privacy to keep their data and consumer interests hidden from malicious actors. Full privacy and information flow control is a longer-term goal that we are working toward with FHE teams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrently, the SDK enables identity-based encryption (IBE) in applications, which is a lightweight encryption scheme that can be used to protect transactions through execution and then decrypt them after based on certain on-chain conditions being met (conditional decryption). IBE incurs no compliance risk to users and helps them sidestep bad-MEV and malicious actors looking to frontrun their on-chain actions, whether in DeFi, gaming or NFT applications. We are working with multiple FHE teams to make FHE a feature inside our SDKs, which will power a new wave of privacy-preserving applications where users can keep the contents of their actions completely private and still perform computation on top of encrypted data. This information flow control will be critical in AI, ML, DeFi, social, and consumer applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Key Milestones & timeline:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Milestone #1: Deploy Decryption Smart Contracts on Near Localnet**\\\\\\\\nGoal: Deploy the identity-based encryption SDK, sample application contract for interacting with the SDK, and the registry contract to Localnet.

During his thesis under the supervision of Sergey Gorbunov (Founder and CEO of Axelar), he completed extensive research on applied cryptography, privacy, and blockchain Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). He has surveyed the trade-offs of harmful MEV prevention methods and published his thesis and two academic papers (one accepted and one under review) on using identity-based encryption and threshold cryptography to protect user transactions in various blockchain architectures. He also leads the R&D team of the  UWaterloo Blockchain Club, and has previous industry experience in advanced cryptography, including designing the architecture of zkMIPS and Entangled Eollups for the ZKM project.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bowen You: CTO & Cofounder**\\\\\\\\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowen-you/), [GitHub](https://github.com/bowenyou)\\\\\\\\nBowen graduated with a Master\\\\\\\\\\\\'s of Mathematics in Statistics at the University of Waterloo focused on deep learning. He developed his technical expertise in blockchain by working as a quantitative researcher at e^{i} Ventures and from running his own trading and MEV bots on various L1s (Solana, Ethereum) and L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum). As a quantitative researcher, he played a vital role in incubating early-stage protocols in the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. Working collaboratively with teams, Bowen applied his statistical and analytical skills to identify valuable insights and opportunities for these protocols. His additional accomplishments include winning multiple prizes at AI and Web3 hackathons, including ETH Denver and the Toronto AI Hackathon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Liam McDonald: Head of Growth**\\\\\\\\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-mcdonald1/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maccanomics)\\\\\\\\nLiam graduated from Loyola University Maryland with a degree in Economics and Finance.

This SDK will unlock a new design space for NEAR developers across AI, DeFi, gaming, and social applications to lead NEAR one step closer to its desired end state as the chain-abstracted hub of blockchain apps. We will make encryption a standard across NEAR.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2014}\\\\\\\\u{2014}\\\\\\\\u{2014}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nRead the full proposal and share your feedback on [DevHub](/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposal&id=63)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\"}, \"index\": {\"post\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"key\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}}\"}}}}"
