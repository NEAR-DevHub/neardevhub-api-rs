        "args": "{\"data\": {\"blog\": {\"near-devhub-funding-guidelines-2036\": {\"\": \"Are you or your team working on a NEAR ecosystem common good project and looking for funding? In this post, we will take a closer look at who determines the funding at DevHub, what factors to consider when proposing the funding amount, and how to submit a funding request.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and empowering anyone to [contribute to the ecosystem](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028). A big part of this is providing financial support to some of the activities that go into bringing innovative projects to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Who determines the funding\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount for a proposal is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, the Work Groups, and the Developer DAO moderators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt starts with the applicant figuring out the appropriate amount to ask for in their proposal based on factors such as project complexity, timeline, and skill levels. Once the applicant posts their proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), various Work Groups evaluate the technical and product aspects of the proposal within their area of expertise. They also assess the project cost considerations, and in some cases negotiate with the applicant. Since Work Groups specialize in different areas, their evaluation may vary. After the Work Groups provide their attestations, the Developer DAO moderators will consolidate the feedback and make the final funding decision. In some cases, the Developer DAO moderators may schedule a public call to meet with the applicant(s) to discuss or negotiate the proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### What factors to consider when determining the funding\\\\\\\\nAll parties mentioned above should use the following factors when determining the funding amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project complexity and duration: Consider the level of effort and the length of the project.\\\\\\\\n- Seniority and skill required for the task. Consider using [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) as a guideline to determine the expected hourly rate for each level of seniority and role.\\\\\\\\n- Temporary nature of the engagement: Adjust for the temporary nature of engagement. Since temporary engagements are less financially secure than full-time job positions, an extra 20-80% markup is potentially justifiable.\\\\\\\\n- Special skills or experience: If the project requires niche skills, such as a proven knowledge of NEAR protocol internals, a person with such skills can justify requesting more compensation.\\\\\\\\n- Economic circumstances: While it is difficult to apply geographic compensation calibration consistently in a blockchain space, it is also unfair to recognize that some teams might have a 4x lower cost of the workforce than other teams due to their geographic location. We expect applicants to be open about it and for Work Groups to enforce [geographic coefficients](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721125654/https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) when the disparity is drastic.\\\\\\\\n- Diversification of the NEAR ecosystem: It is in the interests of DevHub to support multiple entities with funding, rather than giving all grants to a single qualified party. Therefore, in some rare cases, funding may be granted to a party that is slightly less fit but is a newcomer to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Submitting funding requests on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to submit a funding request is through a solution post on [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). You must first create an [idea](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029) post, and reply to it with a solution post type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunding requests guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project details: Include a clear overview of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\n- Budget breakdown: To ensure transparency and increase the chances of approval, the applicant should include a budget breakdown with justification based on the various factors mentioned in the previous section.\\\\\\\\n- Timeline: Projects and their corresponding funding should have a short timeline, preferably under a month. This helps ensure project success by creating a clearly defined scope and minimizing risks. If a project has multiple milestones, propose each milestone as an independent funding request.\\\\\\\\n- Evaluation before funding: The bulk of the evaluation should happen before the project receives the funding. This helps to minimize the risks and ensure the project meets the desired goals.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"NEAR DevHub Funding Guidelines\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"PUBLISH\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-06-21\", \"description\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-10-03\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

In this post, we will take a closer look at who determines the funding at DevHub, what factors to consider when proposing the funding amount, and how to submit a funding request.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and empowering anyone to [contribute to the ecosystem](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028). A big part of this is providing financial support to some of the activities that go into bringing innovative projects to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Who determines the funding\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount for a proposal is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, the Work Groups, and the Developer DAO moderators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt starts with the applicant figuring out the appropriate amount to ask for in their proposal based on factors such as project complexity, timeline, and skill levels. Once the applicant posts their proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), various Work Groups evaluate the technical and product aspects of the proposal within their area of expertise. They also assess the project cost considerations, and in some cases negotiate with the applicant. Since Work Groups specialize in different areas, their evaluation may vary. After the Work Groups provide their attestations, the Developer DAO moderators will consolidate the feedback and make the final funding decision. In some cases, the Developer DAO moderators may schedule a public call to meet with the applicant(s) to discuss or negotiate the proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### What factors to consider when determining the funding\\\\\\\\nAll parties mentioned above should use the following factors when determining the funding amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project complexity and duration: Consider the level of effort and the length of the project.\\\\\\\\n- Seniority and skill required for the task. Consider using [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) as a guideline to determine the expected hourly rate for each level of seniority and role.\\\\\\\\n- Temporary nature of the engagement: Adjust for the temporary nature of engagement. Since temporary engagements are less financially secure than full-time job positions, an extra 20-80% markup is potentially justifiable.\\\\\\\\n- Special skills or experience: If the project requires niche skills, such as a proven knowledge of NEAR protocol internals, a person with such skills can justify requesting more compensation.\\\\\\\\n- Economic circumstances: While it is difficult to apply geographic compensation calibration consistently in a blockchain space, it is also unfair to recognize that some teams might have a 4x lower cost of the workforce than other teams due to their geographic location. We expect applicants to be open about it and for Work Groups to enforce [geographic coefficients](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721125654/https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) when the disparity is drastic.\\\\\\\\n- Diversification of the NEAR ecosystem: It is in the interests of DevHub to support multiple entities with funding, rather than giving all grants to a single qualified party. Therefore, in some rare cases, funding may be granted to a party that is slightly less fit but is a newcomer to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Submitting funding requests on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to submit a funding request is through a solution post on [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). You must first create an [idea](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029) post, and reply to it with a solution post type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunding requests guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project details: Include a clear overview of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\n- Budget breakdown: To ensure transparency and increase the chances of approval, the applicant should include a budget breakdown with justification based on the various factors mentioned in the previous section.\\\\\\\\n- Timeline: Projects and their corresponding funding should have a short timeline, preferably under a month. This helps ensure project success by creating a clearly defined scope and minimizing risks. If a project has multiple milestones, propose each milestone as an independent funding request.\\\\\\\\n- Evaluation before funding: The bulk of the evaluation should happen before the project receives the funding. This helps to minimize the risks and ensure the project meets the desired goals.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"NEAR DevHub Funding Guidelines\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"PUBLISH\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-06-21\", \"description\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-10-03\"}}}}}}"

It walks you through the basics and gets progressively more detailed, allowing you to master Markdown at your own pace. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemember, the goal of using Markdown is to make your proposal clear, readable, and well-presented. Spend a little time familiarizing yourself with Markdown, it will significantly affect how your submission is received.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Filling out the form \\\\\\\\u{270d}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f}\\\\\\\\n##### What do you want to create?\\\\\\\\nIf you are looking for funding, first select \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Solution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Title:\\\\\\\\nCreate an engaging and concise title that encapsulates your proposal. This should grab the attention of potential funders and make them want to know more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Description: \\\\\\\\nThis is the most crucial part of the proposal because it should contain all the information regarding the proposal, including timelines, milestones, costs, etc. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Begin your proposal with an introduction briefly overviewing your project. Describe the project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s objectives, your team, and why you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re passionate about it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Now, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to add a comprehensive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Summary of Activities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is where you outline all the activities you intend to carry out during your project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s duration. Where appropriate, categorize these activities into distinct sections. Each activity should have an associated timeframe, clearly indicating its estimated duration. This summary isn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t merely a formality\\\\\\\\u{2014}it serves a vital purpose in allowing the community to follow the progress of your proposal. Remember to use markdown to create all sections, links, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a first-time poster or a regular forum participant, or even if this proposal builds on previous ones, remember to include links to related past proposals. These links provide crucial context and history for your current project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis section also serves as a resource hub for your proposal. It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the ideal spot to include any additional material that may strengthen your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s case: links to external resources, relevant documentation, explanatory videos, etc. All these materials can enrich your proposal and aid in the review process, making it easier to understand and evaluate your project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Specify a timeline so your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s start and end dates are precise. This allows funders to understand the timeline for your project and when they can expect to see results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Finally, you must specify the particularities of the funding you are requesting and your **justification** (see [factors](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036) to consider). Are you calculating the amount on an hourly basis? If so, how many hours a week, day, or month? What is the hourly or daily rate? Is it milestone based? What part of the funding corresponds to each milestone?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Labels:\\\\\\\\nThis is an optional field that can be left empty, but we encourage you to include any community labels that fit the nature of the proposal. For more information about DevHub communities, you can look [here](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreicihpp65a2ln3e73pklz5mmtif6dcks2obhpk43od3ox3gd554hpu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Are you seeking funding for your solution? \\\\\\\\nIf you are looking for funding, select \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifswtxsckyxdbfhigtygujxxsi2mg2pil5rm74kgfoaz3ovqmo5le)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Currency:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the nomination of the payment, not necessarily how you will be paid. You have three options here. NEAR, USDC, USDT, but please select a USD based currency for ease of assessing your proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreido7l3c5byiehc223tcqvswle5vxbgz7bdi4fjfzfthix5sf2hf44)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Requested amount:\\\\\\\\nHere, ***using numbers only,*** specify the amount you want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreid4f6mqybigrqy3hz6azh56jqcqyd6c37xmas3fv5k2udk2jrrucm)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Requested sponsor:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you specifically request funding from DevHub, you can enter @neardevgov.near. However, you can add any other sponsor, especially if you have already engaged with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreieodsm2s5i674jgzidtdnxanveu6lbuikrdktanrpvsq3mgehpm6q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, you are ready to submit. But before, we suggest you read your proposal before posting to ensure no errors or omissions. Have a team member or mentor review it too. Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re satisfied with how your proposal looks, hit \\\\\\\\\\\\'Submit.\\\\\\\\\\\\' and Congratulations! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve posted your funding proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What Happens Next? \\\\\\\\u{1f647}\\\\\\\\nNow that your proposal has been posted, a few things must happen before you get funded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Amplify:** The appropriate team or community may give feedback to support or reject your proposal. The author\\\\\\\\u{2019}s responsible for getting social support or requesting expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant community groups or individuals. Also, stay active on the forum and respond to any questions or feedback from potential funders. This engagement will show your commitment and may increase your chances of securing funding. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Approval:** If a sponsor such as DevHub decides to approve the proposal, they will reply with a sponsorship post and provide more details about the next steps, such as the KYC process and how to proceed with the payment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What if my proposal is rejected? \\\\\\\\u{1f62f}\\\\\\\\nEven with the best preparation and utmost clarity, there may be instances when a proposal gets rejected. If you find yourself in this situation, we urge you not to be discouraged. Remember, each rejection is an opportunity for learning and improvement. Take the time to understand the feedback provided, evaluate your proposal, and identify areas that can be strengthened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse this setback as fuel to refine your proposal and make it more compelling. Engage with the community, ask questions, seek advice, and don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hesitate to iterate on your ideas. A proposal rejection is not a judgment on your idea\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth or potential but rather an invitation to look at it from a different perspective and make it even more robust.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if your proposal doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get approved on the first try, take a deep breath and prepare to dive back in. Remember, every successful innovator has faced rejection, and your determination and resilience will ultimately turn your vision into a reality. We look forward to your revised proposal and applaud your courage and persistence in bringing your idea to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Decentralizing success \\\\\\\\u{1f31f}\\\\\\\\nPosting your funding proposal on our DevHub forum is a systematic process that, when carefully followed, can significantly increase your chances of gaining the support and backing you need. Clarity, completeness, and enthusiasm are integral to a successful proposal, so this guide has provided a detailed roadmap from drafting and submitting your proposal and navigating the review and approval process. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, remember that a rejected proposal is not the end of the road. Instead, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an opportunity for growth and refinement. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t retreat in the face of failure\\\\\\\\u{2014}welcome it, learn from it, and leverage it as your catalyst to bounce back stronger. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour tenacity and resilience will ultimately be the driving force behind your vision turning into reality. Let these components radiate through your write-up. Now, step forward and give voice to your idea, and remember, the DevHub community is rooting for you, and here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wishing you the best of luck! \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"How to post proposals on DevHub\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"PUBLISH\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"A guide on how to ideate, draft, and post a funding proposal on DevHub\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-06-21\", \"description\": \"A guide on how to ideate, draft, and post a funding proposal on DevHub\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-10-03\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

For more information about DevHub communities, you can look [here](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreicihpp65a2ln3e73pklz5mmtif6dcks2obhpk43od3ox3gd554hpu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Are you seeking funding for your solution? \\\\\\\\nIf you are looking for funding, select \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifswtxsckyxdbfhigtygujxxsi2mg2pil5rm74kgfoaz3ovqmo5le)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Currency:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the nomination of the payment, not necessarily how you will be paid. You have three options here. NEAR, USDC, USDT, but please select a USD based currency for ease of assessing your proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreido7l3c5byiehc223tcqvswle5vxbgz7bdi4fjfzfthix5sf2hf44)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Requested amount:\\\\\\\\nHere, ***using numbers only,*** specify the amount you want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreid4f6mqybigrqy3hz6azh56jqcqyd6c37xmas3fv5k2udk2jrrucm)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Requested sponsor:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you specifically request funding from DevHub, you can enter @neardevgov.near. However, you can add any other sponsor, especially if you have already engaged with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreieodsm2s5i674jgzidtdnxanveu6lbuikrdktanrpvsq3mgehpm6q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, you are ready to submit. But before, we suggest you read your proposal before posting to ensure no errors or omissions. Have a team member or mentor review it too. Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re satisfied with how your proposal looks, hit \\\\\\\\\\\\'Submit.\\\\\\\\\\\\' and Congratulations! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve posted your funding proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What Happens Next? \\\\\\\\u{1f647}\\\\\\\\nNow that your proposal has been posted, a few things must happen before you get funded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Amplify:** The appropriate team or community may give feedback to support or reject your proposal. The author\\\\\\\\u{2019}s responsible for getting social support or requesting expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant community groups or individuals. Also, stay active on the forum and respond to any questions or feedback from potential funders. This engagement will show your commitment and may increase your chances of securing funding. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Approval:** If a sponsor such as DevHub decides to approve the proposal, they will reply with a sponsorship post and provide more details about the next steps, such as the KYC process and how to proceed with the payment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What if my proposal is rejected? \\\\\\\\u{1f62f}\\\\\\\\nEven with the best preparation and utmost clarity, there may be instances when a proposal gets rejected. If you find yourself in this situation, we urge you not to be discouraged. Remember, each rejection is an opportunity for learning and improvement. Take the time to understand the feedback provided, evaluate your proposal, and identify areas that can be strengthened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse this setback as fuel to refine your proposal and make it more compelling. Engage with the community, ask questions, seek advice, and don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hesitate to iterate on your ideas. A proposal rejection is not a judgment on your idea\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth or potential but rather an invitation to look at it from a different perspective and make it even more robust.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if your proposal doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get approved on the first try, take a deep breath and prepare to dive back in. Remember, every successful innovator has faced rejection, and your determination and resilience will ultimately turn your vision into a reality. We look forward to your revised proposal and applaud your courage and persistence in bringing your idea to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Decentralizing success \\\\\\\\u{1f31f}\\\\\\\\nPosting your funding proposal on our DevHub forum is a systematic process that, when carefully followed, can significantly increase your chances of gaining the support and backing you need. Clarity, completeness, and enthusiasm are integral to a successful proposal, so this guide has provided a detailed roadmap from drafting and submitting your proposal and navigating the review and approval process. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, remember that a rejected proposal is not the end of the road. Instead, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an opportunity for growth and refinement. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t retreat in the face of failure\\\\\\\\u{2014}welcome it, learn from it, and leverage it as your catalyst to bounce back stronger. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour tenacity and resilience will ultimately be the driving force behind your vision turning into reality. Let these components radiate through your write-up. Now, step forward and give voice to your idea, and remember, the DevHub community is rooting for you, and here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wishing you the best of luck! \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"How to post proposals on DevHub\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"PUBLISH\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"A guide on how to ideate, draft, and post a funding proposal on DevHub\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-06-21\", \"description\": \"A guide on how to ideate, draft, and post a funding proposal on DevHub\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-10-03\"}}}}}}"

We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Mission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Vision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Example areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem.

If you have a project that improves the NEAR developer experience, DevDAO may be able to provide funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## About DevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO is the primary organization behind DevHub. Our mission is to build a thriving, self-sufficient NEAR developer community by focusing on developer onboarding and engagement.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe support initiatives that make it easier for developers to get started with NEAR, engage with the community, and contribute successfully. Example areas:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevTools**: SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and documentation (Rust and JS stacks) that streamline development.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevRel**: Activities that onboard and engage developers including tutorials, guides, onboarding experiences, community support channels, and IRL/online events.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevHub Portal**: Creating essential tools for managing proposals, treasury, and community collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe want to fund projects that positively impact the NEAR developer journey. Here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what we look for:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Funding Journey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the NEAR developer community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves the key stages below.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 1: Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe proposal life cycle begins when an author submits a draft. During the draft stage, the proposal is open for community comments and the author can still make changes and build consensus.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Get Started**: To submit a draft, navigate to the [/proposals](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals) feed page and click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is a good idea to browse other proposals to learn from previous efforts and consider how your proposal differs from or builds upon existing ideas. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Fill Out Your Draft**: Complete these required fields:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Category: Select the category that best aligns with your project or contribution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Title: Craft a concise and descriptive title that captures the essence of your proposal in a few words. This will appear on your proposal\\\\\\\\u{2019}s detail page and the main proposal feed. Keep it short, please. (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Streamlined Onboarding Tutorials for New NEAR Developers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Summary: Briefly explain your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s goals and the benefits it brings to the NEAR developer community. (Consider using a problem-solution approach: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Problem: New developers struggle to find clear onboarding resources. Solution: We propose creating interactive tutorials...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Description: Expand on your summary with details like your contribution timeline, key milestones, team background, and a clear breakdown of how the funds will be used. Keep the description simple and easy to understand. Proposals should be simple and clear (e.g. 1 month). For more complex projects, treat each milestone as a separate proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Other Fields: Complete all other remaining fields, including KYC/KYB Verification, funding amount, currency preference, NEAR wallet address, requested sponsor, and consent to the Terms & Conditions and Code of Conduct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Submit or Continue Editing**: Click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Submit Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to post the draft to the community, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to start the official review process with DevDAO. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in draft mode. To edit the proposal, click Edit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 2: Review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Move to Review**: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for DevDAO to review your proposal, change the status to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for Review.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This moves your proposal to the review stage and locks the editing function, but comments are still open. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in Review mode. At this point, DevDAO may consider reviewing your proposal. DevHub Community Managers review submitted proposals on a weekly cadence and request from the appropriate Work Groups or DevHub moderators to review. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Community Input**: Your proposal is open for discussion. Engage with the community, consider suggestions, and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Sponsor Review**: DevDAO Moderators review submitted proposals on a regular cadence and may consult relevant working groups for input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNote: If you wish to cancel your proposal, you can click Cancel Proposal. This changes the status to Canceled, signaling to DevDAO that it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s no longer active or relevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 3: Decision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevDAO Evaluation** DevDAO Moderators consider community feedback, available budget, alignment with focus areas, and various other factors to make a collaborative decision. Once the DevDAO Moderators update the decision, they will add a comment to the sponsorship to indicate the decision & next steps. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Possible Decisions**: Approved, Approved (Conditional), Rejected, Canceled (by the author).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 4: Payment Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **KYC/KYB Verification**: If the proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will move the proposal to the Payment Processing stage and first verify that you have already completed KYC/KYB verification to ensure legal compliance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Information Collection & Legal Steps (with NEAR Foundation)**: Once verified, DevDAO moderators will request for you to complete the following required steps with the NEAR Foundation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t1. Complete the Funding Request using the Airtable form.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t2.
