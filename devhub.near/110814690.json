Community contributors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe have a core group of regular product & technical community contributors who regularly work on making the DevHub platform better, from contributing code to reporting and triaging issues. These individuals collaborate across different time zones using lightweight and mostly asynchronous processes. To learn more about how we work, check out our project [README](https://github.com/near/neardevhub-widgets#how-to-contribute) page on GitHub.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## What are we working on?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo track our progress and manage issues effectively, we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/60/views/1). You can also check out our [current](https://github.com/near/neardevhub-widgets/milestones) and [past](https://github.com/near/neardevhub-widgets/milestones?state=closed) initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the following channels for communication:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [GitHub:](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/60/views/1) For specific issues and pull requests. Enable notifications to ensure you get the latest updates.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [Telegram:](https://t.me/devhubplatform) For general questions or concerns.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [Weekly Standup Calls](https://bit.ly/DevHubCalendar): To align on priorities and discuss progress, plans, and blockers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## How to get involved\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to the DevHub platform. Here are ways to get involved:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Contribute code**: Review the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/contribute). You can pick any issues from the [Backlog column](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/60) and indicate your interest by leaving comments. Before you get started, we encourage you to check out [how we work](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/blob/main/docs/how-we-work.md) and the [developer guidelines](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Report issues**: To report a [bug](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) or a [feature request](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request.md&title=), please review all open and closed [issues](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall+) to make sure no one has previously created a similar topic. If you have a more robust proposal or idea that you\\\\\\\\\\\\'d like to discuss, you are also welcome to create an idea or solution post on our community here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Triage issues**: You are welcome to help us triage by verifying or reproducing bugs, adding more specific reproduction instructions, or voting on issues by adding a \\\\\\\\u{1f44d} thumbs-up reaction to the issue\\\\\\\\\\\\'s description comment.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to become a paid contributor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs an an open-source project, we greatly approach the contributions of each individual. We aim to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for regular contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in getting compensate for contributing your skills and expertise to our project, the best way to get started is to first familiarize yourself with [DevHub](https://www.neardevhub.org) and start getting involved (see section above). Once you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ve gained the community\\\\\\\\u{2019}s trust by demonstrating high-quality contributions and ongoing commitment, you can [apply here](https://near.social/#/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=507). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Overview\"}], \"admins\": [\"theori.near\", \"victorkanu1.near\", \"frol.near\"], \"handle\": \"devhub-platform\", \"logo_url\": \"https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigivabiaog2s2qgfsuhyrl7f4jmpdwelsv2jmga6jfdbocsrbgv5i\", \"banner_url\": \"https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreic4xgorjt6ha5z4s5e3hscjqrowe5ahd7hlfc5p4hb6kdfp6prgy4\", \"description\": \"Delivering high impact features to the DevHub Platform.\", \"website_url\": \"neardevhub.org\", \"bio_markdown\": \"A community of product & technical contributors focusing on delivering high impact features to the DevHub Platform that empower NEAR developers to thrive and contribute.\", \"github_handle\": \"/near/neardevhub-widgets/tree/main\", \"twitter_handle\": null, \"telegram_handle\": \"https://t.me/devhubplatform\"}}"
