Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s take this opportunity to talk about what these RPC nodes are and how to run one ourselves.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## What is an RPC node?\\\\\\\\nAn RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node is a system that connects the blockchain with the outside world. This way, users and applications can request information from the blockchain through these RPC nodes and send transactions to be processed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Why would we want to run an RPC node?\\\\\\\\nOne would want to run their own RPC node for multiple reasons. One reason might be having a dedicated RPC for your users and applications so you do not need to rely on public RPCs that might get congested. Another reason is to contribute your node to a private RPC endpoint to help it scale, thus improving the throughput of the network services.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Before we start\\\\\\\\nThis article will follow the official node docs, focusing on setting up a basic node for testnet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`warning: This article will not dwell on server security (e.g., setting up firewalls, rate limiters, etc). We encourage you to read more about hardening (securing) your server and its services.`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### The Hardware\\\\\\\\nThe recommended hardware section on the node docs lists the following config:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHardware\\\\\\\\nRecommended Specifications\\\\\\\\nCPU\\\\\\\\n8-Core (16-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support|\\\\\\\\nCPU Features\\\\\\\\nCMPXCHG16B, POPCNT, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX\\\\\\\\nRAM\\\\\\\\n20GB DDR4\\\\\\\\nStorage\\\\\\\\n1TB NVMe SSD\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRPC nodes store the last five epochs of data, requiring a large amount of storage to accommodate this. However, this amount may vary due to network activity and protocol upgrades, so it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s always better to exceed the recommendations a bit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have a machine with such specifications, we can choose a server provider such as Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Hetzner, or OVH, just to name a few.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Setting up\\\\\\\\nAfter spinning up our server, we can begin setting up our node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tinfo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tSince it is a popular distribution, we will use `Ubuntu 22.04`, so your actual command lines may vary.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following lines will install the necessary packages needed by nearcore and some tools that we will need later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\n# Update system and install relevant apps\\\\\\\\n$ sudo apt update\\\\\\\\n$ sudo apt install -y git binutils-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev cmake gcc g++ python-is-python3 docker.io protobuf-compiler libssl-dev pkg-config clang llvm cargo awscli httpie\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Install Rust\\\\\\\\n$ curl --proto \\\\\\\\\\\\'=https\\\\\\\\\\\\' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\\\\\\\\n$ source \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$HOME/.cargo/env\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Getting and Compiling nearcore\\\\\\\\nWhen writing the latest `nearcore` release is `1.37.0`, make sure to check the latest version on the GitHub repo.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s clone the repository, compile the code, and move the resulting binary into `/usr/local/bin`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore\\\\\\\\n$ cd nearcore\\\\\\\\n$ git fetch origin --tags\\\\\\\\n$ git checkout tags/1.36.5 -b my_rpc_node\\\\\\\\n$ make release\\\\\\\\n$ sudo mv /nearcore/target/release/neard /usr/local/bin/neard\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Initialize a working directory\\\\\\\\nTo run an RPC node we need to initialize a working directory, obtaining the genesis configuration of the blockchain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ neard init --chain-id testnet --download-genesis\\\\\\\\n$ wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/testnet/config.json -P ~/.near/\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`warning\\\\\\\\nWe recommend you run this command with a designated [service account](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/314725/what-is-the-difference-between-user-and-service-account).

This means our node needs to download all the headers and blocks that other nodes in the network already have.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBackups are frequently updated, so we need to determine which one is the latest before syncing the data from it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://near-protocol public/backups/testnet/rpc/latest .\\\\\\\\n$ LATEST=$(cat latest)\\\\\\\\n$ aws s3 --no-sign-request cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://near-protocol-public/backups/testnet/rpc/$LATEST ~/.near/data\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`info`: This will take a while, so you might want to make use of [screen](https://quickref.me/screen) or [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), which we will not be covered in this article\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Running the node\\\\\\\\nStart the node by running\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\n$ neard --home /root/.near run\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur node has synced with the last backup available, but since some time has passed, it will need to catch up with the remaining blocks it missed. At this point, it is normal to see messages such as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`WARN chunks: Error processing partial encoded chunk response: UnknownChunk`\\\\\\\\nor\\\\\\\\n`ERROR network: Failed to store connection attempt. peer_info=PeerInfo ....`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter a while, it should have caught up with the network, and the logs output would look similar:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Congratulations!

To learn more on how to interact with RPC nodes, we can refer to the documentation [found here](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction#near-rpc---quick-links)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get the answer to life, the universe, and everything by calling the function `get_answer` on the smart contract deployed on `the_answer.testnet`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo make the call, we will use [httpie](https://httpie.io/), which we installed already with the packages in the beginning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ http post http://localhost:3030 jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  params:=\\\\\\\\\\\\'{    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"request_type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"call_function\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"finality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"final\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the_answer.testnet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"method_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get_answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args_base64\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"e30=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Interact from across the world\\\\\\\\nIf we try accessing the running service from outside of our server, it will fail because the service is only accessible from within our machine or the local network we are part of. While port forwarding is an option, setting up a reverse proxy is a much better approach.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What is a reverse proxy?**\\\\\\\\n> *A reverse proxy is a server that sits before web servers and forwards client (e.g., web browser) requests to those web servers. Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability*.\\\\\\\\n> [CloudFlare on proxies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)\\\\\\\\nReverse Proxy with NGINX\\\\\\\\n[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is an open-source web server that can also be used for load balancing, server caching and as a reverse proxy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that we have a general idea of what *reverse proxy* is and how it would benefit our node, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go ahead and Install nginx.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ apt install nginx\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe should create an nginx server config file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`\\\\\\\\nWe can name the file anything we want, but usually, the name would be the domain name we are configuring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*We can learn more about on nginx and configuration on the [nginx docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go with `myRPC` with the following content\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n# content of /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRPC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE; # or domain name if you have set one up\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlocation / {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tinclude proxy_params;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can test our nginx config with the following command\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ nginx -t\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter ensuring that our configurations are correct, we can enable our server by linking to it in the `sites-enabled` directory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRpc /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\\\\\\\\n$ systemctl restart nginx\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use httpie from our personal computer (or anywhere in the world really) and interact with the node from outside of the local network of our server\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ http post http://123.123.123 jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  params:=\\\\\\\\\\\\'{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"request_type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"call_function\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"finality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"final\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the_answer.testnet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"method_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get_answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args_base64\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"e30=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successfully returned query will include `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":` with an array of bytes `[52, 50]` in JavaScript we can turn it into a human-readable string like so\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\nString.fromCharCode(...[52, 50])\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\'42\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Enabling SSL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we already have a domain pointed to our server, enabling SSL can be relatively easy using guided tools such as [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe must use a Self-Signed Certificate if we need to get a domain name but want to add SSL to NGINX. Luckily, some articles cover this already, such as [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1) from DigitalOcean.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter enabling SSL, our config file in `sites-available` would look something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # your domain here\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tinclude /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlocation / {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tif ($host = YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE) {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\treturn 301 https://$host$request_uri;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t} # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\treturn 404; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Conclusion\\\\\\\\nIn this article, we delved a bit into RPC nodes, which serve as pivotal connectors between applications and the blockchain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, we have a running node ready to use as a personal service. Before opening it to the public, we should secure the server further and implement rate limiting.\\\\\\\\n\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"3022\", \"title\": \"Running an RPC Node\", \"author\": \"victorkanu1.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"\", \"createdAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"description\": \"\", \"publishedAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"devrel\"}"

Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability*.\\\\\\\\n> [CloudFlare on proxies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)\\\\\\\\nReverse Proxy with NGINX\\\\\\\\n[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is an open-source web server that can also be used for load balancing, server caching and as a reverse proxy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that we have a general idea of what *reverse proxy* is and how it would benefit our node, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go ahead and Install nginx.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ apt install nginx\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe should create an nginx server config file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`\\\\\\\\nWe can name the file anything we want, but usually, the name would be the domain name we are configuring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*We can learn more about on nginx and configuration on the [nginx docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go with `myRPC` with the following content\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n# content of /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRPC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE; # or domain name if you have set one up\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlocation / {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tinclude proxy_params;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can test our nginx config with the following command\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ nginx -t\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter ensuring that our configurations are correct, we can enable our server by linking to it in the `sites-enabled` directory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRpc /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\\\\\\\\n$ systemctl restart nginx\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use httpie from our personal computer (or anywhere in the world really) and interact with the node from outside of the local network of our server\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ http post http://123.123.123 jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  params:=\\\\\\\\\\\\'{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"request_type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"call_function\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"finality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"final\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"account_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the_answer.testnet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"method_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get_answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args_base64\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"e30=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successfully returned query will include `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":` with an array of bytes `[52, 50]` in JavaScript we can turn it into a human-readable string like so\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\nString.fromCharCode(...[52, 50])\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\'42\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Enabling SSL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we already have a domain pointed to our server, enabling SSL can be relatively easy using guided tools such as [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe must use a Self-Signed Certificate if we need to get a domain name but want to add SSL to NGINX. Luckily, some articles cover this already, such as [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1) from DigitalOcean.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter enabling SSL, our config file in `sites-available` would look something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # your domain here\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tinclude /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlocation / {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nserver {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tif ($host = YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE) {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\treturn 301 https://$host$request_uri;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t} # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten 80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tlisten [::]:80;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\treturn 404; # managed by Certbot\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Conclusion\\\\\\\\nIn this article, we delved a bit into RPC nodes, which serve as pivotal connectors between applications and the blockchain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, we have a running node ready to use as a personal service. Before opening it to the public, we should secure the server further and implement rate limiting.\\\\\\\\n\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"3022\", \"title\": \"Running an RPC Node\", \"author\": \"victorkanu1.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"\", \"createdAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"updatedAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"description\": \"\", \"publishedAt\": \"2024-02-18\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}}}"
