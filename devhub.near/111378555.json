Through various researches, investigations, and rigorous discussions, we aim to build secure, reliable, and scalable blockchain infrastructure, where the vision of Blockchain OS and innovative Web3 apps can live on. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in how NEAR blockchain works and want to make contributions, this is the place for you!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## What is this space about\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis space aims to serve as an entry point to individuals, experts, and organizations who are interested in contributing to the ongoing innovation of the NEAR protocol. You will be able to find information about ongoing community programs, access to relevant documentations, and communication channels for you to participate in.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Community Groups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs of now, the Protocol community consists of two groups: working group(PWG) and community group.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Protocol working group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis formal group is a selected committee of subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals related to the NEAR protocol. They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO or grant programs, and hold grant takers accountable. They engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. Due to its significance, we pay special attention to the member selection process and make sure that each member can bring unique perspectives and experiences to improve NEAR protocol. With great power comes great responsibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Current committee members\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA protocol working group member will constantly seek a community member with deep expertise on how protocol works. When a qualified candidate is discovered, the committee goes through the nomination and alignment process to send an invitation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCurrent committee members are as follows:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Bowen Wang ([Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/))\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Near social: [@woben.near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=woben.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [bowenwang1996](https://github.com/bowenwang1996)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marcelo Fornet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Near social: [@marcelo.near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=marcelo.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [mfornet](https://github.com/mfornet)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Telegram: mnaeraxr\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marcin Michalski ([Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/))\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [mm-near](https://github.com/mm-near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Michael Birch (Aurora)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Responsibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Make decisions on Near Enhancement Proposals(A.K.A NEPs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Budget allocation for protocol development initiatives including RFPs, security audits, etc. This includes review of funding requests.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Steer the general direction of protocol development\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Attend Protocol work group calls \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Message on Telegram channel: [link](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Post on NEAR.org and tag [Pagoda](https://near.org/near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=pagodaplatform.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Protocol community group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCommunity group is an open group providing a space for anyone interested in changes to the NEAR protocol. Unlike the Protocol working group, the community group does not require any commitment or membership. It focuses on offering a place where members can freely ask questions, seek/offer support, exchange ideas and initiate discussions. All contributors to nearcore repository, including [Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/) protocol team members, are implicit members of the community, and actively participate in community discussions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Protocol Community Group TG Channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Ongoing projects\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Protocol roadmap](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/q1-protocol-roadmap-update-progress-and-changes-e2d61626e4a1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Github \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [Major projects](https://github.com/near/nearcore/labels/C-tracking-issue)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [Discussions](https://github.com/near/nearcore/discussions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [PRs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pulls)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Sponsored projects](https://near.social/#/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.Sponsorship?label=protocol)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Attend periodic Protocol community group calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Documents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nProtocol community maintains several documents/wikis so community members can stay informative and efficient to find what they are seeking for. Here are major worth noting ones.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Guide to nearcore development](https://near.github.io/nearcore/index.html): Explains how each part of nearcore operates, e.g. how state sync, garbage collection, epoch works, how storage layer interacts with the layers on top, etc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Nomicon](https://nomicon.io/): Near protocol specification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near nodes](https://near-nodes.io/): Explains how near node works and how one can become a node operator \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near doc](https://docs.near.org/develop/welcome): Walks you through on how to develop on top of NEAR protocol, e.g. how to build a smart contract on NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn): Learn Rust, the programming language NEAR protocol is written in\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"About Us\"}, {\"id\": \"730ru7\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to contribute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Protocol community group runs various events and programs you can participate in to improve NEAR blockchain. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Virtual meet ups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nStay up-to-date on upcoming and past events in the NEAR protocol space. Whether it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a monthly community call, hackathon, or meetup, you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll find the details here to connect with other community members.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCurrently, we have two periodic virtual meetups, one for general community group and another for working group.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Community Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Protocol Community Group hosts a monthly call to connect, share ideas or concerns, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the NEAR protocol.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to join the call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFind out about the latest meetings below or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Who can attend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnyone is welcome to attend the monthly call. Whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re an individual, organization, or an expert in the NEAR Protocol, it is open to all. Each call is recorded and posted on this page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Format\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe monthly call is a free-format discussion with basic moderation. Anyone can volunteer to facilitate and lead future calls. The agenda typically starts with introductions from participants and follows with a list of potential discussion topics. The group will prioritize the topics based on what participants want to discuss the most. Topics may include updates from various members on any developments or initiatives, presentations on the latest research, as well as open discussion from questions and ideas to challenges and opportunities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Work Group Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMostly, Protocol Working group reviews and discusses NEP asynchronously within the NEP\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public thread. This allows for broad participation and ensures transparency.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, if a discussion becomes circular and could benefit from a synchronous conversation, the Protocol Working Group may host public formal calls to review specific proposals, discuss attestations, or vote on decisions. For example, if a reviewer and author have multiple rounds of comments, they may request a call. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Monthly protocol engineer virtual meetup day\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce a month, protocol engineers meet virtually on [Gather town](https://app.gather.town/app) to simulate \\\\\\\\u{2018}office working environment\\\\\\\\u{2019} by presenting in the virtual workspace during their work hours. By doing so, we encourage adhoc discussions and conversations to build stronger relationships and maximize our creativity. During this day, we also host a social hour so we can have fun activities together as well.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nVirtual working day schedule is shared on [Zulip general stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/virtual.20meetup.20day)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Bug bounty program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBug bounty program is to leverage power of community to make NEAR protocol more secure and fraud-proof. If you notice any issues that can be a threat to our users on nearcore repo, please report them and claim the bounty! Please follow the [LINK](https://hackenproof.com/near/near-protocol) to Hacken proof Near protocol page to know more about the program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Funding Proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have the idea that can make NEAR protocol more scalable/reliable/secure, you can submit a proposal to get funding for your precious time and effort. Currently, NEAR DevDAO is running the funding program by collaborating with Protocol working group. Once a proposal is submitted, DevDAO will work with Protocol working group to determine the necessity of the project by thoroughly reviewing the proposal. Once conclusion is made, DevDAO will reach out to the proposer to share the final decision and work with them on the next step.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about the guidelines and how to submit a proposal for funding, please visit [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=developer-dao&tab=funding). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### How to participate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThere are several ways to participate in community activities.
