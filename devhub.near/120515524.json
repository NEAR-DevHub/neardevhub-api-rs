The full component library is expected to be ready for use by the end of the following week.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. **Serialization Clarifications:**\\\\\\\\n   - Discussions have clarified the usage of NearToken and U128 for serialization purposes, ensuring efficient handling of data structures in contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. **Developer Queries Resolution:**\\\\\\\\n   - Queries regarding the serialization of u64/u128 in structs and the necessity of creating separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs have been addressed within the community. It was clarified that it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not necessary to create separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs. Instead, developers can use the **NearToken** struct for both cases and implement JSON and Borsh serialization for this single struct. **NearToken** is serialized as a native u128 for Borsh and as a string-encoded number for JSON, ensuring efficient serialization for both formats. This resolution simplifies development processes and ensures consistency in handling u64/u128 data types within contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. **SDK Review and Discussions:**\\\\\\\\n   - Ongoing discussions and reviews of tools and libraries such as near-api-js have taken place, focusing on best practices for contract calling methods and key management approaches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. **cargo-near Build Tool Development:**\\\\\\\\n    - Development of the `cargo-near build` tool is in progress to assist with reproducible builds and linking compiled wasm contracts with their code, providing solutions for consistent builds across different computers.\\\\\\\\n    - \\\\\\\\u{1f449}[GitHub Pull Request #134](https://github.com/near/cargo-near/pull/134) outlines the ongoing development and testing process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. **SDK Version Compatibility:**\\\\\\\\n    - Updates have been made to SDK versions to ensure compatibility with the latest tools and libraries, facilitating smoother development workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n13. **Pagoda:** \\\\\\\\n- Improved QueryAPI logging system and DB connection pooling resulting in ~2-10 times better indexing performance.\\\\\\\\n- KitWallet has been migrated to use QueryAPI for Access Keys indexer, making it more reliable for wallets that still use KitWallet.\\\\\\\\n- QueryAPI hit all-time-high of 1.05M requests on April 26th, peaking at 400 req/second with ~250ms 95th percentile and ~15ms median GraphQL response time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14. **Automated Verification Processes:**\\\\\\\\n    - Plans for automation of `cargo-near` verify processes are in place to streamline developer workflows and enhance code verification efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n15. **Developer Feedback Solicitation:**\\\\\\\\n    - Developers have been encouraged to provide feedback on tools, libraries, and documentation to drive continuous improvement and enhance the developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n16: **New Framework for Indexers: inindexer:**\\\\\\\\n- [inindexer](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) is a new framework that allows you to build your own custom indexer to react to the transactions and other events on chain (Examples are included).

This effort includes consolidating information on basics, state/storage, functions, and interfaces.\\\\\\\\n   - Links to migrated documentation:\\\\\\\\n     - [Basics Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/)\\\\\\\\n     - [State/Storage Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/functions)\\\\\\\\n     - [Functions and Interface Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/functions)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Documentation Maintenance:**\\\\\\\\n   - Several broken links within existing documentation have been identified and addressed.\\\\\\\\n   - Ongoing updates and improvements are being made to documentation pages to enhance clarity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **New Documentation feature:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Code Navigator was released on docs \\\\\\\\u{1f6a8}\\\\\\\\u{1f389}, A new tool in docs that\\\\\\\\\\\\'s able to better explain code-related concepts! Please check it and give us feedback so we can improve it! Click \\\\\\\\u{1f449}[here](https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Sample Code Repositories:**\\\\\\\\n   - GitHub repositories for auction examples and storage examples have been shared within the community, providing developers with useful code snippets and resources.\\\\\\\\n   - [Auction Examples Repository](https://github.com/near-examples/auction-examples)\\\\\\\\n   - [Storage Examples Repository](https://github.com/near-examples/storage-examples)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **Developer Tools Optimization:**\\\\\\\\n   - Efforts towards dependencies cleanup and potential refactoring of NEAR crates are underway. This initiative will streamline dependencies, reduce unnecessary ones, and introduce robust CI/CD workflows.\\\\\\\\n   - [Issue #8888](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/8888) outlines ongoing efforts towards dependency management and cleanup within NEAR crates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Developer Community Engagement:**\\\\\\\\n   - The Tools Community Call #6 is scheduled for May 14th, 2024, inviting you to participate, share updates, and discuss projects.\\\\\\\\n   - [Join the Community Call](https://bit.ly/tools-call-6-meet)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. **UI for NEAR Project Progress:**\\\\\\\\n   - Significant progress has been made on the UI for NEAR project, with 75% of components ready and 40% of documentation completed. The full component library is expected to be ready for use by the end of the following week.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. **Serialization Clarifications:**\\\\\\\\n   - Discussions have clarified the usage of NearToken and U128 for serialization purposes, ensuring efficient handling of data structures in contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. **Developer Queries Resolution:**\\\\\\\\n   - Queries regarding the serialization of u64/u128 in structs and the necessity of creating separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs have been addressed within the community. It was clarified that it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not necessary to create separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs. Instead, developers can use the **NearToken** struct for both cases and implement JSON and Borsh serialization for this single struct. **NearToken** is serialized as a native u128 for Borsh and as a string-encoded number for JSON, ensuring efficient serialization for both formats. This resolution simplifies development processes and ensures consistency in handling u64/u128 data types within contracts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. **SDK Review and Discussions:**\\\\\\\\n   - Ongoing discussions and reviews of tools and libraries such as near-api-js have taken place, focusing on best practices for contract calling methods and key management approaches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. **cargo-near Build Tool Development:**\\\\\\\\n    - Development of the `cargo-near build` tool is in progress to assist with reproducible builds and linking compiled wasm contracts with their code, providing solutions for consistent builds across different computers.\\\\\\\\n    - \\\\\\\\u{1f449}[GitHub Pull Request #134](https://github.com/near/cargo-near/pull/134) outlines the ongoing development and testing process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. **SDK Version Compatibility:**\\\\\\\\n    - Updates have been made to SDK versions to ensure compatibility with the latest tools and libraries, facilitating smoother development workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n13. **Pagoda:** \\\\\\\\n- Improved QueryAPI logging system and DB connection pooling resulting in ~2-10 times better indexing performance.\\\\\\\\n- KitWallet has been migrated to use QueryAPI for Access Keys indexer, making it more reliable for wallets that still use KitWallet.\\\\\\\\n- QueryAPI hit all-time-high of 1.05M requests on April 26th, peaking at 400 req/second with ~250ms 95th percentile and ~15ms median GraphQL response time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14. **Automated Verification Processes:**\\\\\\\\n    - Plans for automation of `cargo-near` verify processes are in place to streamline developer workflows and enhance code verification efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n15. **Developer Feedback Solicitation:**\\\\\\\\n    - Developers have been encouraged to provide feedback on tools, libraries, and documentation to drive continuous improvement and enhance the developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n16: **New Framework for Indexers: inindexer:**\\\\\\\\n- [inindexer](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) is a new framework that allows you to build your own custom indexer to react to the transactions and other events on chain (Examples are included).
