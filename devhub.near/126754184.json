Successfully launching it as a self-sustaining SaaS solution at this point is unlikely due to the immaturity and small size of the market.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nLantstool is an [open-source](https://github.com/lantstools/ui.web.lantstool) web application that allows interaction with the NEAR Protocol from a browser, and enables users to save, modify, and reuse these interactions according to their needs.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThe primary mission of Lantstool is to make the development of new products on the NEAR Protocol more efficient and to simplify the onboarding of new developers into the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThe proposal is authored by [Volodymyr Bilyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volodymyr-bilyk-11395a317/), Lantstool founder, ex-NEAR Foundation Core Contributor, Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### History\\\\\\\\nThe idea for the application originated back in 2021 during my time at NEAR Foundation when I was working on [Linkdrop](https://github.com/agileurbanite/contracts.near-linkdrop). At that time, I had to do a lot of development and testing of contracts on the testnet, as well as manually invoke contract methods to check how the frontend was working. The only way to do this without writing code was through NEAR CLI.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nWhile NEAR CLI served its purpose, it had certain inconveniences:\\\\\\\\n- It was not convenient to save and reuse commands: the process involved writing commands in a text file and performing hundreds of copy-paste cycles every day.\\\\\\\\n- It was challenging to edit function calls with complex argument structures.\\\\\\\\n- It was difficult to create transactions with multiple actions.\\\\\\\\n- There was a constant need to share updated commands with other team members.\\\\\\\\n- There was no convenient access to commands from different devices.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThese and other factors led to constant confusion and ultimately decreased development productivity. I also learned that other developers acquaintances were facing similar problems.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nIn November 2023, I decided to start developing an application that would solve these issues and assist me (and potentially others) in daily work. First, I developed the technical specifications, project architecture, and UI/UX, and then I hired a frontend developer for paid assistance in building the project. Today, 10 months after the start, the MVP is ready and partially addresses the problems described above.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Overview\\\\\\\\n[Lantstool](https://lantstool.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/lantstools/ui.web.lantstool) web application with the following features:\\\\\\\\n- Allows for easy creation of transactions with multiple actions (7/9 types of actions are available, excluding Stake and DelegateActions) using the UI, with options to save and reuse them.\\\\\\\\n- To sign transactions, a key needs to be imported. The application always saves imported keys even after account deletion, which allows for a convenient setup of a pipeline like Create Account -> Deploy Contract -> Call Method -> Delete Account without the need to change existing transactions. Additionally, when importing through Seed Phrase, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible to specify the Derivation Path.\\\\\\\\n- Allows creation, storage, and reuse of all types of RPC calls.\\\\\\\\n- Transactions and calls can have meaningful names and can be reorganized in lists using Drag&Drop.\\\\\\\\n- When calling a contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s View Method, all available exported WASM methods of that contract can be viewed.\\\\\\\\n- Contract ABI can be reviewed.\\\\\\\\n- Frequently used accounts can be saved, and their balances/metadata/keys can be reviewed.\\\\\\\\n- Supports both mainnet and testnet.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAll data is stored locally in the user\\\\\\\\\\\\'s browser (IndexedDB), ensuring security and privacy. The application is currently free, with unlimited access, and does not require any registration.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAccording to metrics, there are currently 300+ unique visitors per month. The project has been mentioned several times in NEAR Devhub news and was also presented during [Tools Community Call #10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBIAcQj7nFs).\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Goals\\\\\\\\nThe global goals of this project are:\\\\\\\\n- Provide quick and convenient access to blockchain functions without the need to install additional software.\\\\\\\\n- Assist in accelerating the development of new projects and make maintaining existing ones easier.\\\\\\\\n- Simplify the onboarding of new developers into the ecosystem and reduce the learning curve.\\\\\\\\n- Optimize teamwork.\\\\\\\\n- Enable access to data from different devices.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nFuture functional expansions are also being considered:\\\\\\\\n- Integration of other blockchains into the application - with the development of Chain Abstraction, developers will be able to work with multiple blockchains from one application.\\\\\\\\n- Creating a desktop version of the application with extended functionality (e.g., automated transaction calls for testing).\\\\\\\\n- Creating the possibility of launching private blockchains in one click.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAll of this aims to help the NEAR Protocol ecosystem grow and develop.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Milestone 1\\\\\\\\nThe main objectives of the first milestone are:\\\\\\\\n- Improve UI/UX\\\\\\\\n- Add useful features (such as ABI integration)\\\\\\\\n- Bug fixing and bringing the application to production-ready status\\\\\\\\n- Integration into NEAR Docs and the ecosystem as a whole\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThis funding proposal only covers Milestone 1 and does not include any other possible future milestones.\\\\\\\\n#### Tasks & Estimates\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n- Migrate data from the current IndexedDB to PouchDB / RxDB - 5d\\\\\\\\n- Change the application architecture to support multiple blockchains in the future - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Improve the routing system - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Redesign the application and improve the overall UI/UX (design + frontend) - 15d\\\\\\\\n- Add validations for transactions/calls - 5d \\\\\\\\n- Add hints in transactions/calls - 2d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate full ABI support (including automatic argument insertion for function calls) - <10d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to load contract state in a readable format - <5d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to automatically generate and save new accounts/keys after creation/addition - 2d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate key import into the dropdown in the transaction form, add the ability to select NEAR | yoctoNEAR for transaction - function call - 1d \\\\\\\\n- Create a Tools page - generate a new seed phrase, implicit account, converter near -> yoctoNear (or FT), base64 -> string, gas -> tGas, etc. (design + frontend) - 4d\\\\\\\\n- Create a Networks page and allow importing other networks by simply entering RPC / deleting them, changing RPC from the list, or adding your own, integrating auto-change RPC (design + frontend) - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Create a Spaces page - allow creating/editing/deleting spaces (design + code) - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to export/import as JSON/JSON file for spaces/transactions/calls (design + frontend) - 9d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to load sample transactions/calls via a link (only for selected samples, without user ability to create their own) (design + frontend + backend) - 7d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- How should it work? The user follows a link to the application, and is automatically directed to a page with a ready transaction, where they only need to insert their key. This should simplify onboarding for new users exploring NEAR possibilities through NEAR Docs.\\\\\\\\n- Add and set up metrics - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate examples (URL + JSON) on how to use Lantstool into the official [NEAR Protocol documentation](https://docs.near.org/) - 10d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add examples to all places in Docs/Tutorials where CLI is used \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add a section in Tools with examples of all application functions (similar to the CLI guide)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add examples in RPC - how each RPC call can be made in Lantstool\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Total time - 90d**\\\\\\\\nDesign - 13d\\\\\\\\nDevelopment - 77d\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThis milestone should be completed no later than 31.12.2024\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n#### Budget\\\\\\\\nThe total budget for this milestone is **$28096 USD**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n**Salaries - $27490**\\\\\\\\nTeam Lead / Full Stack Developer - 75%h * $50 / h = $23100\\\\\\\\nFrontend Developer = 25%h * $15 / h = $2310\\\\\\\\nDesigner = $20 / h = $2080\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n**Tools & Infrastructure - $606**\\\\\\\\nFigma - $60 / m * 4 = $240\\\\\\\\nNetlify - $19 / m * 6 = $114\\\\\\\\nAWS - < $30 / m * 6 = $180\\\\\\\\nDomain - $72 / y = $72\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n#### Team\\\\\\\\n[Volodymyr Bilyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volodymyr-bilyk-11395a317/) (full-time) - Lantstool founder, ex-NEAR Foundation Core Contributor (2021-2024), Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience.

Successfully launching it as a self-sustaining SaaS solution at this point is unlikely due to the immaturity and small size of the market.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nLantstool is an [open-source](https://github.com/lantstools/ui.web.lantstool) web application that allows interaction with the NEAR Protocol from a browser, and enables users to save, modify, and reuse these interactions according to their needs.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThe primary mission of Lantstool is to make the development of new products on the NEAR Protocol more efficient and to simplify the onboarding of new developers into the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThe proposal is authored by [Volodymyr Bilyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volodymyr-bilyk-11395a317/), Lantstool founder, ex-NEAR Foundation Core Contributor, Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### History\\\\\\\\nThe idea for the application originated back in 2021 during my time at NEAR Foundation when I was working on [Linkdrop](https://github.com/agileurbanite/contracts.near-linkdrop). At that time, I had to do a lot of development and testing of contracts on the testnet, as well as manually invoke contract methods to check how the frontend was working. The only way to do this without writing code was through NEAR CLI.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nWhile NEAR CLI served its purpose, it had certain inconveniences:\\\\\\\\n- It was not convenient to save and reuse commands: the process involved writing commands in a text file and performing hundreds of copy-paste cycles every day.\\\\\\\\n- It was challenging to edit function calls with complex argument structures.\\\\\\\\n- It was difficult to create transactions with multiple actions.\\\\\\\\n- There was a constant need to share updated commands with other team members.\\\\\\\\n- There was no convenient access to commands from different devices.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThese and other factors led to constant confusion and ultimately decreased development productivity. I also learned that other developers acquaintances were facing similar problems.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nIn November 2023, I decided to start developing an application that would solve these issues and assist me (and potentially others) in daily work. First, I developed the technical specifications, project architecture, and UI/UX, and then I hired a frontend developer for paid assistance in building the project. Today, 10 months after the start, the MVP is ready and partially addresses the problems described above.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Overview\\\\\\\\n[Lantstool](https://lantstool.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/lantstools/ui.web.lantstool) web application with the following features:\\\\\\\\n- Allows for easy creation of transactions with multiple actions (7/9 types of actions are available, excluding Stake and DelegateActions) using the UI, with options to save and reuse them.\\\\\\\\n- To sign transactions, a key needs to be imported. The application always saves imported keys even after account deletion, which allows for a convenient setup of a pipeline like Create Account -> Deploy Contract -> Call Method -> Delete Account without the need to change existing transactions. Additionally, when importing through Seed Phrase, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible to specify the Derivation Path.\\\\\\\\n- Allows creation, storage, and reuse of all types of RPC calls.\\\\\\\\n- Transactions and calls can have meaningful names and can be reorganized in lists using Drag&Drop.\\\\\\\\n- When calling a contract\\\\\\\\\\\\'s View Method, all available exported WASM methods of that contract can be viewed.\\\\\\\\n- Contract ABI can be reviewed.\\\\\\\\n- Frequently used accounts can be saved, and their balances/metadata/keys can be reviewed.\\\\\\\\n- Supports both mainnet and testnet.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAll data is stored locally in the user\\\\\\\\\\\\'s browser (IndexedDB), ensuring security and privacy. The application is currently free, with unlimited access, and does not require any registration.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAccording to metrics, there are currently 300+ unique visitors per month. The project has been mentioned several times in NEAR Devhub news and was also presented during [Tools Community Call #10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBIAcQj7nFs).\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Goals\\\\\\\\nThe global goals of this project are:\\\\\\\\n- Provide quick and convenient access to blockchain functions without the need to install additional software.\\\\\\\\n- Assist in accelerating the development of new projects and make maintaining existing ones easier.\\\\\\\\n- Simplify the onboarding of new developers into the ecosystem and reduce the learning curve.\\\\\\\\n- Optimize teamwork.\\\\\\\\n- Enable access to data from different devices.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nFuture functional expansions are also being considered:\\\\\\\\n- Integration of other blockchains into the application - with the development of Chain Abstraction, developers will be able to work with multiple blockchains from one application.\\\\\\\\n- Creating a desktop version of the application with extended functionality (e.g., automated transaction calls for testing).\\\\\\\\n- Creating the possibility of launching private blockchains in one click.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nAll of this aims to help the NEAR Protocol ecosystem grow and develop.\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n### Milestone 1\\\\\\\\nThe main objectives of the first milestone are:\\\\\\\\n- Improve UI/UX\\\\\\\\n- Add useful features (such as ABI integration)\\\\\\\\n- Bug fixing and bringing the application to production-ready status\\\\\\\\n- Integration into NEAR Docs and the ecosystem as a whole\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThis funding proposal only covers Milestone 1 and does not include any other possible future milestones.\\\\\\\\n#### Tasks & Estimates\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n- Migrate data from the current IndexedDB to PouchDB / RxDB - 5d\\\\\\\\n- Change the application architecture to support multiple blockchains in the future - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Improve the routing system - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Redesign the application and improve the overall UI/UX (design + frontend) - 15d\\\\\\\\n- Add validations for transactions/calls - 5d \\\\\\\\n- Add hints in transactions/calls - 2d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate full ABI support (including automatic argument insertion for function calls) - <10d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to load contract state in a readable format - <5d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to automatically generate and save new accounts/keys after creation/addition - 2d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate key import into the dropdown in the transaction form, add the ability to select NEAR | yoctoNEAR for transaction - function call - 1d \\\\\\\\n- Create a Tools page - generate a new seed phrase, implicit account, converter near -> yoctoNear (or FT), base64 -> string, gas -> tGas, etc. (design + frontend) - 4d\\\\\\\\n- Create a Networks page and allow importing other networks by simply entering RPC / deleting them, changing RPC from the list, or adding your own, integrating auto-change RPC (design + frontend) - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Create a Spaces page - allow creating/editing/deleting spaces (design + code) - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to export/import as JSON/JSON file for spaces/transactions/calls (design + frontend) - 9d\\\\\\\\n- Add the ability to load sample transactions/calls via a link (only for selected samples, without user ability to create their own) (design + frontend + backend) - 7d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t- How should it work? The user follows a link to the application, and is automatically directed to a page with a ready transaction, where they only need to insert their key. This should simplify onboarding for new users exploring NEAR possibilities through NEAR Docs.\\\\\\\\n- Add and set up metrics - 3d\\\\\\\\n- Integrate examples (URL + JSON) on how to use Lantstool into the official [NEAR Protocol documentation](https://docs.near.org/) - 10d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add examples to all places in Docs/Tutorials where CLI is used \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add a section in Tools with examples of all application functions (similar to the CLI guide)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t - Add examples in RPC - how each RPC call can be made in Lantstool\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Total time - 90d**\\\\\\\\nDesign - 13d\\\\\\\\nDevelopment - 77d\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\nThis milestone should be completed no later than 31.12.2024\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n#### Budget\\\\\\\\nThe total budget for this milestone is **$28096 USD**\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n**Salaries - $27490**\\\\\\\\nTeam Lead / Full Stack Developer - 75%h * $50 / h = $23100\\\\\\\\nFrontend Developer = 25%h * $15 / h = $2310\\\\\\\\nDesigner = $20 / h = $2080\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n**Tools & Infrastructure - $606**\\\\\\\\nFigma - $60 / m * 4 = $240\\\\\\\\nNetlify - $19 / m * 6 = $114\\\\\\\\nAWS - < $30 / m * 6 = $180\\\\\\\\nDomain - $72 / y = $72\\\\\\\\n&nbsp;\\\\\\\\n#### Team\\\\\\\\n[Volodymyr Bilyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volodymyr-bilyk-11395a317/) (full-time) - Lantstool founder, ex-NEAR Foundation Core Contributor (2021-2024), Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience.
