We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Mission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Vision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Example areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The Funding Board shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our funding guidelines.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Overview\"}, {\"id\": \"2te4j0\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to get help\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Welcome to DevHub!

If you have a project that improves the NEAR developer experience, DevDAO may be able to provide funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## About DevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO is the primary organization behind DevHub. Our mission is to build a thriving, self-sufficient NEAR developer community by focusing on developer onboarding and engagement.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe support initiatives that make it easier for developers to get started with NEAR, engage with the community, and contribute successfully. Example areas:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevTools**: SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and documentation (Rust and JS stacks) that streamline development.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevRel**: Activities that onboard and engage developers including tutorials, guides, onboarding experiences, community support channels, and IRL/online events.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevHub Portal**: Creating essential tools for managing proposals, treasury, and community collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe want to fund projects that positively impact the NEAR developer journey. Here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what we look for:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Funding Journey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the NEAR developer community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves the key stages below.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 1: Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe proposal life cycle begins when an author submits a draft. During the draft stage, the proposal is open for community comments and the author can still make changes and build consensus.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Get Started**: To submit a draft, navigate to the [/proposals](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals) feed page and click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is a good idea to browse other proposals to learn from previous efforts and consider how your proposal differs from or builds upon existing ideas. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Fill Out Your Draft**: Complete these required fields:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Category: Select the category that best aligns with your project or contribution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Title: Craft a concise and descriptive title that captures the essence of your proposal in a few words. This will appear on your proposal\\\\\\\\u{2019}s detail page and the main proposal feed. Keep it short, please. (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Streamlined Onboarding Tutorials for New NEAR Developers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Summary: Briefly explain your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s goals and the benefits it brings to the NEAR developer community. (Consider using a problem-solution approach: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Problem: New developers struggle to find clear onboarding resources. Solution: We propose creating interactive tutorials...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Description: Expand on your summary with details like your contribution timeline, key milestones, team background, and a clear breakdown of how the funds will be used. Keep the description simple and easy to understand. Proposals should be simple and clear (e.g. 1 month). For more complex projects, treat each milestone as a separate proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Other Fields: Complete all other remaining fields, including KYC/KYB Verification, funding amount, currency preference, NEAR wallet address, requested sponsor, and consent to the Terms & Conditions and Code of Conduct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Submit or Continue Editing**: Click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Submit Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to post the draft to the community, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to start the official review process with DevDAO. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in draft mode. To edit the proposal, click Edit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 2: Review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Move to Review**: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for DevDAO to review your proposal, change the status to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for Review.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This moves your proposal to the review stage and locks the editing function, but comments are still open. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in Review mode. At this point, DevDAO may consider reviewing your proposal. DevHub Community Managers review submitted proposals on a weekly cadence and request from the appropriate Work Groups or DevHub moderators to review. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Community Input**: Your proposal is open for discussion. Engage with the community, consider suggestions, and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Sponsor Review**: DevDAO Moderators review submitted proposals on a regular cadence and may consult relevant working groups for input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNote: If you wish to cancel your proposal, you can click Cancel Proposal. This changes the status to Canceled, signaling to DevDAO that it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s no longer active or relevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 3: Decision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevDAO Evaluation** DevDAO Moderators consider community feedback, available budget, alignment with focus areas, and various other factors to make a collaborative decision. Once the DevDAO Moderators update the decision, they will add a comment to the sponsorship to indicate the decision & next steps. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Possible Decisions**: Approved, Approved (Conditional), Rejected, Canceled (by the author).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 4: Payment Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **KYC/KYB Verification**: If the proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will move the proposal to the Payment Processing stage and first verify that you have already completed KYC/KYB verification to ensure legal compliance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Information Collection & Legal Steps (with NEAR Foundation)**: Once verified, DevDAO moderators will request for you to complete the following required steps with the NEAR Foundation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t1. Complete the Funding Request using the Airtable form.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t2. Sign the agreement after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation legal team using Ironclad.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t3. Submit the final invoice after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation finance team using Request Finance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t4. Confirm the test transaction after receiving a test transaction confirmation email from the NEAR Foundation finance team. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Payment Disbursement**: Typically, funds are disbursed within 10 business days, but timelines may vary.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 5: Funded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Transparency**: Once funded, payment details are made public on the proposal page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Need More Help?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have further questions, please post a comment on the [DevHub

We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Mission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Vision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Example areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem.

Our mission is to build a thriving, self-sufficient NEAR developer community by focusing on developer onboarding and engagement.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe support initiatives that make it easier for developers to get started with NEAR, engage with the community, and contribute successfully. Example areas:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevTools**: SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and documentation (Rust and JS stacks) that streamline development.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevRel**: Activities that onboard and engage developers including tutorials, guides, onboarding experiences, community support channels, and IRL/online events.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevHub Portal**: Creating essential tools for managing proposals, treasury, and community collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe want to fund projects that positively impact the NEAR developer journey. Here\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what we look for:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Funding Journey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the NEAR developer community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves the key stages below.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 1: Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe proposal life cycle begins when an author submits a draft. During the draft stage, the proposal is open for community comments and the author can still make changes and build consensus.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Get Started**: To submit a draft, navigate to the [/proposals](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals) feed page and click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is a good idea to browse other proposals to learn from previous efforts and consider how your proposal differs from or builds upon existing ideas. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Fill Out Your Draft**: Complete these required fields:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Category: Select the category that best aligns with your project or contribution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Title: Craft a concise and descriptive title that captures the essence of your proposal in a few words. This will appear on your proposal\\\\\\\\u{2019}s detail page and the main proposal feed. Keep it short, please. (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Streamlined Onboarding Tutorials for New NEAR Developers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Summary: Briefly explain your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s goals and the benefits it brings to the NEAR developer community. (Consider using a problem-solution approach: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Problem: New developers struggle to find clear onboarding resources. Solution: We propose creating interactive tutorials...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Description: Expand on your summary with details like your contribution timeline, key milestones, team background, and a clear breakdown of how the funds will be used. Keep the description simple and easy to understand. Proposals should be simple and clear (e.g. 1 month). For more complex projects, treat each milestone as a separate proposal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t* Other Fields: Complete all other remaining fields, including KYC/KYB Verification, funding amount, currency preference, NEAR wallet address, requested sponsor, and consent to the Terms & Conditions and Code of Conduct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Submit or Continue Editing**: Click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Submit Draft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to post the draft to the community, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" if ready to start the official review process with DevDAO. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in draft mode. To edit the proposal, click Edit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 2: Review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Move to Review**: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for DevDAO to review your proposal, change the status to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ready for Review.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This moves your proposal to the review stage and locks the editing function, but comments are still open. After confirming the transaction, you will see your proposal in Review mode. At this point, DevDAO may consider reviewing your proposal. DevHub Community Managers review submitted proposals on a weekly cadence and request from the appropriate Work Groups or DevHub moderators to review. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Community Input**: Your proposal is open for discussion. Engage with the community, consider suggestions, and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Sponsor Review**: DevDAO Moderators review submitted proposals on a regular cadence and may consult relevant working groups for input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNote: If you wish to cancel your proposal, you can click Cancel Proposal. This changes the status to Canceled, signaling to DevDAO that it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s no longer active or relevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 3: Decision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **DevDAO Evaluation** DevDAO Moderators consider community feedback, available budget, alignment with focus areas, and various other factors to make a collaborative decision. Once the DevDAO Moderators update the decision, they will add a comment to the sponsorship to indicate the decision & next steps. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Possible Decisions**: Approved, Approved (Conditional), Rejected, Canceled (by the author).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 4: Payment Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **KYC/KYB Verification**: If the proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will move the proposal to the Payment Processing stage and first verify that you have already completed KYC/KYB verification to ensure legal compliance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Information Collection & Legal Steps (with NEAR Foundation)**: Once verified, DevDAO moderators will request for you to complete the following required steps with the NEAR Foundation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t1. Complete the Funding Request using the Airtable form.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t2. Sign the agreement after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation legal team using Ironclad.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t3. Submit the final invoice after receiving an email from the NEAR Foundation finance team using Request Finance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t4. Confirm the test transaction after receiving a test transaction confirmation email from the NEAR Foundation finance team. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Payment Disbursement**: Typically, funds are disbursed within 10 business days, but timelines may vary.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage 5: Funded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Transparency**: Once funded, payment details are made public on the proposal page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Need More Help?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have further questions, please post a comment on the [DevHub Platform](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=devhub-platform&tab=discussions) community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding\"}, {\"id\": \"p6oi6p\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"kanban\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"metadata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d75543a-74d7f407-7399035d--1d4c470b--618b59a7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kanban.post_board\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Funding Board\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ticket\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kanban.post_ticket\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"features\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"author\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"like_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reply_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sponsorship_request_indicator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"requested_sponsorship_value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"requested_sponsor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"approved_sponsorship_value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sponsorship_supervisor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":true}}},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"payload\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"columns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d76a815--1edac41b--3ce2a206--9bdb7ae--37dcbaae\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-new-request\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d76a815--1edac41b--3ce2a206--9bdb7ae--37dcbaae\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d794c2e--48bb331e--23b4b2de--272c8ae4-6eaf133c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-information-collection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get Info\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get details\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d794c2e--48bb331e--23b4b2de--272c8ae4-6eaf133c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d79e6dd-21c0f704-601485dc--5cce796e-6bcfcd0e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d79e6dd-21c0f704-601485dc--5cce796e-6bcfcd0e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7a6b4b--2256b752--3a17ea80--501fa43c-2b579107\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7a6b4b--2256b752--3a17ea80--501fa43c-2b579107\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7aa83f-3c05aa44-6dfce22b--15d06696-303e0016\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tag\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"funding-funded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Paid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18c8d7aa83f-3c05aa44-6dfce22b--15d06696-303e0016\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"excluded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[]}}}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding Board\"}], \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"
