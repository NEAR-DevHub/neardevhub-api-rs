Open-source models for code generation made huge progress lastly and a lot of very performative LLMs have been released in 2023, almost reaching an equivalent quality as the most powerful proprietary models. They can be of great support for developers in the context of a growing ecosystem such as Near.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"An Empirical Comparison of Pre-Trained Models of source code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2023) found that CodeT5 (2021) outperforms 19 recently-developed pre-trained models of source code on the most useful software engineering tasks for the purpose of a coding assistant: Code Translation, Bug Fixing, Code Summarization, and Code Generation. CodeT5 is pre-trained on the CodeSearchNet dataset, featuring 6 programming languages: Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby. It misses Rust, an important language for Near smart contracts, and doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t include Typescript, HTML, and CSS, which are still useful for creating Near apps through ReactJs/NextJs frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2023) further improves CodeT5 through multi-task training and is pre-trained on the GitHub Code datasets from Code Parrot (incl. Rust, Typescript, HTML, CSS).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AST-T5: Structure-Aware Pretraining for Code Generation and Understanding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2024) manages to significantly outperform T5 by using a structure-aware pre-training paradigm called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LocalRQA: From Generating Data to Locally Training, Testing, and Deploying Retrieval-Augmented QA Systems\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2024) demonstrates how LLMs performance can be significantly improved using local Retrieval-augmented Question-Answering systems, allowing the model to parse a collection of local documents before answering a user\\\\\\\\u{2019}s query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal of this grant would be to create an AST-CodeT5+ with a LocalRQA pipeline on all available Near Docs, open repositories, and resources to build the best coding assistant for Near Developers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis initiative is supported by an academic program at the University of Kiel, leveraging the expertise of senior AI researchers and data scientists from April to June 2024. The development timeline targets a wrapped app release in July 2024. It could take the form of a classic webapp, BOS widgets or a VS code extension, this is open to discussion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount is calculated on a 2-months FTE for a machine learning engineer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis endeavor is spearheaded by Julien Carbonnell (@jcarbonnell), whose journey in Machine Learning since 2020 has been marked by a deep dive into Natural Language Processing and Transformer models within neural networks.\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"devbot.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"8000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"labels\": []}"

This innovative approach leverages recent advancements in pre-trained models and retrieval-augmented systems to empower Near developers with efficient code generation and understanding capabilities.\", \"category\": \"Tooling & Infrastructure\", \"timeline\": {\"status\": \"DRAFT\"}, \"editor_id\": \"devbot.near\", \"timestamp\": \"1713308831803927502\", \"supervisor\": null, \"description\": \"A barrier to entry for many developers is the lack of existing code to adapt or blend into new ones for their applications. Open-source models for code generation made huge progress lastly and a lot of very performative LLMs have been released in 2023, almost reaching an equivalent quality as the most powerful proprietary models. They can be of great support for developers in the context of a growing ecosystem such as Near.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"An Empirical Comparison of Pre-Trained Models of source code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2023) found that CodeT5 (2021) outperforms 19 recently-developed pre-trained models of source code on the most useful software engineering tasks for the purpose of a coding assistant: Code Translation, Bug Fixing, Code Summarization, and Code Generation. CodeT5 is pre-trained on the CodeSearchNet dataset, featuring 6 programming languages: Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby. It misses Rust, an important language for Near smart contracts, and doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t include Typescript, HTML, and CSS, which are still useful for creating Near apps through ReactJs/NextJs frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2023) further improves CodeT5 through multi-task training and is pre-trained on the GitHub Code datasets from Code Parrot (incl. Rust, Typescript, HTML, CSS).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AST-T5: Structure-Aware Pretraining for Code Generation and Understanding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2024) manages to significantly outperform T5 by using a structure-aware pre-training paradigm called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LocalRQA: From Generating Data to Locally Training, Testing, and Deploying Retrieval-Augmented QA Systems\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (2024) demonstrates how LLMs performance can be significantly improved using local Retrieval-augmented Question-Answering systems, allowing the model to parse a collection of local documents before answering a user\\\\\\\\u{2019}s query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal of this grant would be to create an AST-CodeT5+ with a LocalRQA pipeline on all available Near Docs, open repositories, and resources to build the best coding assistant for Near Developers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis initiative is supported by an academic program at the University of Kiel, leveraging the expertise of senior AI researchers and data scientists from April to June 2024. The development timeline targets a wrapped app release in July 2024. It could take the form of a classic webapp, BOS widgets or a VS code extension, this is open to discussion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount is calculated on a 2-months FTE for a machine learning engineer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis endeavor is spearheaded by Julien Carbonnell (@jcarbonnell), whose journey in Machine Learning since 2020 has been marked by a deep dive into Natural Language Processing and Transformer models within neural networks.\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"devbot.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"8000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDT\"}, \"author_id\": \"devbot.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
