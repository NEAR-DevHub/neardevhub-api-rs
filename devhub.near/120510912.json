If she has a solution already fully figured out in her mind, she might choose to implement it without announcing it or seeking validation, or to fundraise entirely on her own. Also, her idea might not have anything to do with writing code. Perhaps she is offering to review or audit someone else\\\\\\\\u{2019}s project, or to organize a technical event, etc. Regardless of what she chooses to do and not do, there are four categories of developer community activity she can choose to engage with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeveloper Governance is both a decentralized social structure and a set of tools. As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Ideate\\\\\\\\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way. But people cannot be just thrusted into general purpose chats where their ideas are buried in the noise and where it is hard to discover like-minded people. Based on our experience in other Open Source communities, we adopted the concept of a Community Group (CG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a self-organized circle of people interested in a specific topic. CGs are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them and anyone can create a CG with the specialization they want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in ideation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubmit your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Join an existing [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) and discuss ideas\\\\\\\\n- Start a new [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Implement\\\\\\\\nCoding is the defining feature of the development community, and we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want to create any barriers in the way of community members who just want to write some code. We recognize that sometimes coding is done in response to some idea and that people can discover ideas as the result of coding. However, we want the coding to be inclusive and therefore if you want to submit your implementation specification, you first need to describe an idea even if it is vague. In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\\\\\\\\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Review\\\\\\\\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone\\\\\\\\u{2019}s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. \\\\\\\\u{201c}wg-protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\\\\\\\\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Support \\\\\\\\n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects.

This post dives further into the ideation area.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step in any NEAR ecosystem project is ideation. It is crucial to have a way to find people to share and explore ideas with, partly because it can save a lot of time based on prior discussions. But also because it can help strengthen your ideas & gauge support from a diversity of stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are three ways to get started:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Sharing ideas on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to share an idea is in the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Anyone can add an idea in any shape or form. The more your idea is fleshed out, the higher chances it will receive votes and comments. By posting an idea, you are inviting others to comment or propose their solutions. It is critical to specify what sort of response you are hoping for.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow to share an idea:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1) Check for prior ideas:** Before posting your idea, please search the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) for similar ideas to learn from previous efforts. If you find a similar idea, consider how your proposed idea differs from or builds upon the existing one. If you already have a solution in mind, consider responding with a Solution Post to an existing idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2) Create a post:** In the [proposal feed](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), Click Create Idea and fill out all the fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Posting guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Labels \\\\\\\\u{2013} The appropriate label categories\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Title \\\\\\\\u{2013}  A short summary of the proposed idea\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Description \\\\\\\\u{2013} The relevant information and rationale to enable the community to provide feedback. Describe the problem or opportunity your idea is addressing, as well as your desired outcome. It is also helpful to include a clear call to action for community members, such as asking for feedback on how to improve certain aspects of the idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3) Share with the ecosystem:** Once posted, the author is responsible for gathering social support or expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant Community Groups or individuals and leading the discussion further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4) Iterate:** Monitor your post for any replies and take the time to follow up with people who provided feedback. If you are ready to move from idea to implementation, consider submitting a Solution Post to your idea or encouraging others to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample Post:\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifjcyk2cj64aol2uh5pb76brytv3affg335rzczj3tzgkyhuulbtq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Exploring ideas using existing community groups\\\\\\\\nIf you have an early seed for an idea, or a topic area you are interested in exploring, consider joining an existing developer Community Group (CG). CGs are self-organized groups of people interested in a specific topic, such as Zero Knowledge or Wallet Standards. They are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them. They offer a great opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with like-minded people. Most groups have a dedicated social channel, like Telegram, as well as regular  video calls or in-person events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How to engage with an existing group:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Search for groups: Browse the list of existing [Community Groups](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) to familiarize yourself with their topic area, guidelines, and communication channels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Get involved: Join the CG\\\\\\\\u{2019}s dedicated social channel and learn about their recent activities. Don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t forget to introduce yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Join events: Review previous meeting notes/recordings and register for upcoming meetings. In the future, consider volunteering to speak about a topic or even to lead the meeting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Participate in discussions: Comment on existing ideas or discussions. Or propose a new idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample ideas:\\\\\\\\n- A vague wish: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I think it would be great if NEAR supported ZK contracts\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A highly detailed multi-page specification: A  new consensus algorithm\\\\\\\\n- A concern: \\\\\\\\u{201c}near-api-js does not use TypeScript everywhere and it is kinda concerning to me\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A stackoverflow problem: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I cannot figure out how to make Markdown work in near.social\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Starting a new community group\\\\\\\\nIf none of the existing CGs work for you, consider [creating your own CG](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more insights and to stay up to date on our latest updates, sign up for our newsletter below or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NEARDevGov) and [Telegram](https://t.me/NEARDevGov).\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"2029\", \"title\": \"How to ideate on DevHub\", \"author\": \"theori.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"description\": \"A guide for sharing and exploring ideas with others to evolve the NEAR ecosystem.\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

Perhaps she is offering to review or audit someone else\\\\\\\\u{2019}s project, or to organize a technical event, etc. Regardless of what she chooses to do and not do, there are four categories of developer community activity she can choose to engage with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeveloper Governance is both a decentralized social structure and a set of tools. As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Ideate\\\\\\\\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way. But people cannot be just thrusted into general purpose chats where their ideas are buried in the noise and where it is hard to discover like-minded people. Based on our experience in other Open Source communities, we adopted the concept of a Community Group (CG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a self-organized circle of people interested in a specific topic. CGs are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them and anyone can create a CG with the specialization they want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in ideation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubmit your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Join an existing [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) and discuss ideas\\\\\\\\n- Start a new [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Implement\\\\\\\\nCoding is the defining feature of the development community, and we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want to create any barriers in the way of community members who just want to write some code. We recognize that sometimes coding is done in response to some idea and that people can discover ideas as the result of coding. However, we want the coding to be inclusive and therefore if you want to submit your implementation specification, you first need to describe an idea even if it is vague. In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\\\\\\\\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Review\\\\\\\\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone\\\\\\\\u{2019}s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. \\\\\\\\u{201c}wg-protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\\\\\\\\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Support \\\\\\\\n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects. NEAR Foundation, NDC, and various accelerators have different criteria and motivation to sponsor and support ecosystem projects. However, they don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have resources to review all applications and oversee proper utilization of funds. While we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want our developer community to be centered around funding, we want to make funding as easy as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSponsors can quickly explore projects matching their criteria by using filtering with labels (coming soon) and checking out the attestations submitted by the experts, e.g. Work Groups. They can also request reviews from WG in the comments of the ideas and submissions. Once they find projects that are matching their criteria, they can negotiate the cost in the comments or delegate it to the Work Group experts. Finally, they can submit a sponsorship with and designate an expert to supervise funds utilization, which might require paying them a fee. is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects.

In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\\\\\\\\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Review\\\\\\\\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone\\\\\\\\u{2019}s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. \\\\\\\\u{201c}wg-protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\\\\\\\\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Support \\\\\\\\n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects. NEAR Foundation, NDC, and various accelerators have different criteria and motivation to sponsor and support ecosystem projects. However, they don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have resources to review all applications and oversee proper utilization of funds. While we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want our developer community to be centered around funding, we want to make funding as easy as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSponsors can quickly explore projects matching their criteria by using filtering with labels (coming soon) and checking out the attestations submitted by the experts, e.g. Work Groups. They can also request reviews from WG in the comments of the ideas and submissions. Once they find projects that are matching their criteria, they can negotiate the cost in the comments or delegate it to the Work Group experts. Finally, they can submit a sponsorship with and designate an expert to supervise funds utilization, which might require paying them a fee. is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects.

This post dives further into the ideation area.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step in any NEAR ecosystem project is ideation. It is crucial to have a way to find people to share and explore ideas with, partly because it can save a lot of time based on prior discussions. But also because it can help strengthen your ideas & gauge support from a diversity of stakeholders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are three ways to get started:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Sharing ideas on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to share an idea is in the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Anyone can add an idea in any shape or form. The more your idea is fleshed out, the higher chances it will receive votes and comments. By posting an idea, you are inviting others to comment or propose their solutions. It is critical to specify what sort of response you are hoping for.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow to share an idea:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1) Check for prior ideas:** Before posting your idea, please search the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) for similar ideas to learn from previous efforts. If you find a similar idea, consider how your proposed idea differs from or builds upon the existing one. If you already have a solution in mind, consider responding with a Solution Post to an existing idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2) Create a post:** In the [proposal feed](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), Click Create Idea and fill out all the fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Posting guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Labels \\\\\\\\u{2013} The appropriate label categories\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Title \\\\\\\\u{2013}  A short summary of the proposed idea\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{2022} Description \\\\\\\\u{2013} The relevant information and rationale to enable the community to provide feedback. Describe the problem or opportunity your idea is addressing, as well as your desired outcome. It is also helpful to include a clear call to action for community members, such as asking for feedback on how to improve certain aspects of the idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3) Share with the ecosystem:** Once posted, the author is responsible for gathering social support or expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant Community Groups or individuals and leading the discussion further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4) Iterate:** Monitor your post for any replies and take the time to follow up with people who provided feedback. If you are ready to move from idea to implementation, consider submitting a Solution Post to your idea or encouraging others to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample Post:\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifjcyk2cj64aol2uh5pb76brytv3affg335rzczj3tzgkyhuulbtq)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Exploring ideas using existing community groups\\\\\\\\nIf you have an early seed for an idea, or a topic area you are interested in exploring, consider joining an existing developer Community Group (CG). CGs are self-organized groups of people interested in a specific topic, such as Zero Knowledge or Wallet Standards. They are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them. They offer a great opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with like-minded people. Most groups have a dedicated social channel, like Telegram, as well as regular  video calls or in-person events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How to engage with an existing group:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Search for groups: Browse the list of existing [Community Groups](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) to familiarize yourself with their topic area, guidelines, and communication channels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Get involved: Join the CG\\\\\\\\u{2019}s dedicated social channel and learn about their recent activities. Don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t forget to introduce yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Join events: Review previous meeting notes/recordings and register for upcoming meetings. In the future, consider volunteering to speak about a topic or even to lead the meeting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Participate in discussions: Comment on existing ideas or discussions. Or propose a new idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample ideas:\\\\\\\\n- A vague wish: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I think it would be great if NEAR supported ZK contracts\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A highly detailed multi-page specification: A  new consensus algorithm\\\\\\\\n- A concern: \\\\\\\\u{201c}near-api-js does not use TypeScript everywhere and it is kinda concerning to me\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- A stackoverflow problem: \\\\\\\\u{201c}I cannot figure out how to make Markdown work in near.social\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3.

We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Mission\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Values\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Vision\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Sponsorships\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2015), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=home) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The [Funding Board](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Boards?selectedBoardId=funding) shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our [funding guidelines](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036).\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"2032\", \"title\": \"NEAR Developer DAO\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"reference\", \"subtitle\": \"Empowering a decentralized developer community\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"description\": \"Empowering a decentralized developer community\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"

We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Mission\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Values\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Vision\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Sponsorships\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2015), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=home) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The [Funding Board](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Boards?selectedBoardId=funding) shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our [funding guidelines](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036).\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"2032\", \"title\": \"NEAR Developer DAO\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"reference\", \"subtitle\": \"Empowering a decentralized developer community\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"description\": \"Empowering a decentralized developer community\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-03\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}}}"
