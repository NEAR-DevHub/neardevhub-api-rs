They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO, and hold grant takers accountable. They also engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Members**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- @frol.near\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- @ori.near\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- @bo.near\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### 2. Community contributors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe have a core group of regular product & technical community contributors who regularly work on making the DevHub platform better, from contributing code to reporting and triaging issues. These individuals collaborate across different time zones using lightweight and mostly asynchronous processes. To learn more about how we work, check out our project [README](https://github.com/near/neardevhub-widgets#how-to-contribute) page on GitHub.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## What are we working on?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo track our progress and manage issues effectively, we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/60/views/1).
