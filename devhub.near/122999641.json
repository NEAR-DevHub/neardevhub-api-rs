We dove into more details in our recent episode of [DevHub Live](https://youtube.com/live/tWNdPtQsMwo), but here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a quick recap of the exciting initiatives that fueled our progress and a glimpse into what\\\\\\\\u{2019}s coming up next in Q3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Q2 Highlights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f6e0}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Tooling**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Ledger Integration:** Finalized and security audited the NEAR App for Ledger devices.
