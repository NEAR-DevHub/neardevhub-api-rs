We prioritized two key goals: empowering developers and fostering a thriving community. We dove into more details in our recent episode of DevHub Live ([https://youtube.com/live/tWNdPtQsMwo](https://youtube.com/live/tWNdPtQsMwo)), but here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a quick recap of the exciting initiatives that fueled our progress and a glimpse into what\\\\\\\\u{2019}s coming up next in Q3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Q2 Highlights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f6e0}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Tooling**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Ledger Integration:** Finalize and security audited the NEAR App for Ledger devices. We plan to launch soon after Ledger\\\\\\\\u{2019}s new Stax device release. This integration will bring greater security to NEAR users.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **CLI Enhancements:** Streamlined CLI tooling, making it easier for newcomers to the NEAR ecosystem and resulting in faster development cycles.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **SDK Upgrade:** Released near-sdk-js 2.0, empowering JavaScript developers to create robust smart contracts.\\\\\\\\u{a0}\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f4da} Developer Support**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Chain Abstraction:** Placed chain abstraction at the forefront of our educational efforts. New documentation pages with clear explanations and hands-on examples make it easier for developers to create applications that seamlessly span multiple blockchains.\\\\\\\\n*   **Documentation Overhaul:** Revamped resources with intuitive navigation, fresh onboarding examples, and a series of \\\\\\\\u{201c}What is\\\\\\\\u{2026}\\\\\\\\u{201d} pages that break down complex concepts. Standardized tutorials now ensure a consistent learning experience across the board.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f31f} DevHub Portal**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **New Proposal Experience:** Launched a new [streamlined proposal workflow](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=3251) that facilitates a smoother funding journey. In Q2 alone, this system facilitated over $500,000 in funding across 80 proposals. Since launching our platform, over 17 open source community contributors have helped close 400 PRs in the DevHub GitHub repo.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **Scaling DevHub Portal:** Introduced committee portals for the events and infrastructure committees. This expansion marks a significant step towards a common layer that supports decision making & funding across ecosystem projects.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f91d} Community Engagement**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **NEAR Dev News:** Published 12 newsletters in Q2 with a 40% average open rate and subscriber base of 889. NEAR Dev News has become the go-to source for ecosystem updates and is gaining traction across regional communities, with the Ludium community translating content into local languages.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **DevHub Live:** Launched a weekly DevHub live call to feature prominent people and news in the ecosystem. So far, our 12 episodes have averaged 100-150 live viewers, with an additional 500+ views from replays.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **Social Growth:** Increased social media presence with 337 social media posts featuring original video content., reaching over 143k impressions. Also introduced Instagram and Tiktok to our social profiles, with TikTok achieving over 50k views and 2200 interactions.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **Community Calls:** Held 14 community calls (Contract Standards, Zero Knowledge, Tooling, Protocol), with over 130 combined attendees. Also launched the Chain Abstraction community, hosting two calls with 50 attendees.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **NEPs Collaboration:** Three working groups coordinated the approval of four NEPs (NEP 519, NEP 330, NEP 536, and NEP 522) and thoughtfully rejected one (NEP 530), demonstrating the community\\\\\\\\u{2019}s commitment to quality standards within the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f30d} Events**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur [Hackbox](https://dev.near.org/hackbox.near/widget/home) initiative powered a series of successful hackathons across the globe in Q2, showcasing the vversatility of NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s technology while attracting new developers and projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Key Highlights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **HawkHacks 2024 (Waterloo, Ontario)** attracted a strong turnout with 1,289 registrants and 701 in-person attendees. The NEAR track was particularly active, with 36 out of 148 submitted projects focusing on NEAR technologies. Blockchain gaming emerged as a burgeoning area of development, evidenced by the 20 submissions in the NEAR: TENAMINT x GamingDAO track. Standout projects included \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"basemint\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a NEAR cryptocurrency ESports marketplace), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nearbound\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a gaming platform on NEAR), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"NeARchive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a fully on-chain VR museum).\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **AI Chain NEAR Tunisia** brought together 34 participants who formed 10 teams. These teams tackled the intersection of AI and blockchain, resulting in innovative projects like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Courchain\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a decentralized e-learning platform) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Handala\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a healthcare data management platform).\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n*   **ETHBerlin NEAR HackShop** fostered collaboration within the developer community. 50 new members joined the Builders Telegram group, and the focus on cross-chain development was evident in challenges that involved integrating EVM/BTC elements. 11 submissions were received, with $1,500 awarded in bounties for challenges that promoted interoperability through integrating EVM/BTC elements.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAcross all Q2 Hackbox events, there were a total of **1,354** sign-ups, **735** in-person attendees, **169** projects submitted, and over **$15,000** USDC awarded in bounties.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Looking Ahead to Q3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a sneak peek at what\\\\\\\\u{2019}s coming in Q3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **\\\\\\\\u{1f6e0}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f} Tooling**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   **Race of Sloths:** We\\\\\\\\u{2019}re launching a new initiative to help boost developer contributions to open-source projects.
