They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO or grant programs, and hold grant takers accountable. They engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Members**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [Bo Yao](https://github.com/ailisp)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [David Millar-Durrant](https://github.com/DavidM-D)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [Serhii Volovyk](https://github.com/volovyks)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Community Group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis informal self-organized group provides a space for anyone interested in the NEAR tooling. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to meet with others to share ideas and submit proposals. This group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. The group has a dedicated Telegram channel.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Communication Channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [Tooling Community Group in Telegram](https://t.me/NEAR_Tools_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Here on the Discussions page!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Check the Events tab for upcoming Community/Work Group calls.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\u{2019}d like to add links to your project, interesting reference material for the community, or anything else worth linking here, please reach out to the community lead!
