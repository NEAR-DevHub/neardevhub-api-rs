Through various researches, investigations, and rigorous discussions, we aim to build secure, reliable, and scalable blockchain infrastructure, where the vision of Blockchain OS and innovative Web3 apps can live on. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in how NEAR blockchain works and want to make contributions, this is the place for you!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Structure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs of now, the Protocol community consists of two groups: working group(PWG) and community group.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Protocol working group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis formal group is a selected committee of subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals related to the NEAR protocol. They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO or grant programs, and hold grant takers accountable. They engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. Due to its significance, we pay special attention to the member selection process and make sure that each member can bring unique perspectives and experiences to improve NEAR protocol. With great power comes great responsibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### WG Members\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA protocol working group member will constantly seek a community member with deep expertise on how protocol works. When a qualified candidate is discovered, the committee goes through the nomination and alignment process to send an invitation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCurrent committee members are as follows:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Bowen Wang ([Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/))\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Near social: [@woben.near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=woben.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [bowenwang1996](https://github.com/bowenwang1996)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marcelo Fornet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Near social: [@marcelo.near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=marcelo.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [mfornet](https://github.com/mfornet)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Telegram: mnaeraxr\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marcin Michalski ([Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/))\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * Github: [mm-near](https://github.com/mm-near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Michael Birch (Aurora)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### WG Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Make decisions on Near Enhancement Proposals(A.K.A NEPs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Budget allocation for protocol development initiatives including RFPs, security audits, etc. This includes review of funding requests.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Steer the general direction of protocol development\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Attend Protocol work group calls \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Message on Telegram channel: [link](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Post on NEAR.org and tag [Pagoda](https://near.org/near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=pagodaplatform.near)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Protocol community group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCommunity group is an open group providing a space for anyone interested in changes to the NEAR protocol. Unlike the Protocol working group, the community group does not require any commitment or membership. It focuses on offering a place where members can freely ask questions, seek/offer support, exchange ideas and initiate discussions. All contributors to nearcore repository, including [Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/) protocol team members, are implicit members of the community, and actively participate in community discussions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Protocol Community Group TG Channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Protocol community group calls (Join our telegram Channel to stay up to date)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"About Us \\\\\\\\u{2b50}\\\\\\\\u{fe0f}\"}, {\"id\": \"730ru7\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Welcome to the community\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#### The Protocol Community Group organizes various events and programs aimed at enhancing the NEAR blockchain. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Community Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Protocol Community Group conducts a monthly call to facilitate connection, idea sharing, and staying updated on NEAR protocol developments.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**- How to Join the Call:** Stay updated on upcoming meetings either below or via our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**- Who Can Attend:** The monthly call is open to everyone, whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re an individual, organization, or NEAR Protocol expert. Each call is recorded and posted on this page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**- Format:** The monthly call follows a free-format discussion with basic moderation. Participants can volunteer to lead future calls. Typically, the agenda starts with participant introductions, followed by discussions on various topics prioritized based on participants\\\\\\\\\\\\' interests. Topics may include updates from members, presentations on research, and open discussions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Work Group Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Protocol Working Group primarily reviews and discusses NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) asynchronously within the NEPs\\\\\\\\\\\\' public thread to encourage broad participation and ensure transparency. However, synchronous public formal calls may be hosted if a discussion becomes circular and would benefit from real-time conversation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Monthly Protocol Engineer Virtual Meetup Day\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce a month, protocol engineers gather virtually on [Gather Town](https://app.gather.town/app) to simulate an \\\\\\\\\\\\'office working environment\\\\\\\\\\\\' during their work hours. This setup fosters ad hoc discussions and strengthens relationships. Additionally, we host a social hour for fun activities during this day. The schedule for the virtual working day is shared on the [Zulip general stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/virtual.20meetup.20day).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Bug Bounty Program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Bug Bounty Program aims to enhance the security and integrity of the NEAR protocol by leveraging the community\\\\\\\\\\\\'s expertise. If you identify any issues that could pose a threat to our users on the nearcore repository, please report them and claim the bounty! Learn more about the program [here](https://hackenproof.com/near/near-protocol).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Funding Proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have ideas to enhance NEAR protocol scalability, reliability, or security, you can submit a proposal to receive funding for your efforts. Currently, NEAR DevDAO manages the funding program in collaboration with the Protocol Working Group. Once a proposal is submitted, DevDAO and the Protocol Working Group review it thoroughly to determine its necessity. Subsequently, DevDAO communicates the final decision to the proposer and collaborates on the next steps. For guidelines on submitting a proposal for funding, visit [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=developer-dao&tab=funding).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&nbsp; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## More ways to participate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThere are various ways to participate in community activities:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To share feedback or initiate discussions with developers, use the [Zulip pagoda/core stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore) or the Protocol Community Group discussion board.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- For questions about the NEAR protocol, ask in the [Zulip pagoda/core/questions topic](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore/topic/questions), Protocol Telegram, Protocol Community Group discussion board, or Near social.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To work on a simple issue and learn about the NEAR protocol, request an onboarding task in the [Zulip pagoda/core stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore) or check out GitHub issues labeled with good-first-issue [here](https://github.com/near/nearcore/labels/C-good-first-issue).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To communicate with the Pagoda protocol team, start a conversation in the [Zulip pagoda/core stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore) and tag @ protocol.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To learn about proposals on protocol specifications, visit the [Github NEP board](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/51/views/3) or read through the [Near Enhancement Proposal guideline](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To request funding for an idea, check the \\\\\\\\\\\\'Event\\\\\\\\\\\\' tab.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- To claim a reward for finding a bug on NEAR, check the \\\\\\\\\\\\'Event\\\\\\\\\\\\' tab.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"How to contribute \\\\\\\\u{1f468}\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\u{1f4bb}\"}, {\"id\": \"3i6q64\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"blog\", \"parameters\": \"{}\", \"display_name\": \"Community Call Recaps \\\\\\\\u{1f4de}\"}, {\"id\": \"dmqrwf\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our Docs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nProtocol community maintains several documents/wikis so community members can stay informative and efficient to find what they are seeking for.

To get started, all you need is some spare time, a computer with Node.js installed, and a GitHub account.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## New to NEAR?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re new in the ecosystem, consider contributing by choosing a specific topic and following the documentation from start to finish. For instance, you can go through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"building smart contracts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" docs and take notes on any areas where you face challenges\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA web developer with real world experience in building applications (specially backend technologies) should be able to go through the docs. If you have such expertise and do not manage to understand the docs, then you have found a documentation problem! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, reach out through Telegram or Discord to seek clarification and then contribute by improving the docs to benefit others with your newfound knowledge.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Forking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a local instance of the docs: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Fork the official docs repository \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. Navigate to the `website` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. Install all dependencies by running (`npm install`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. Start a local version of the docs by running (`npm start`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Modifying an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Locate the relevant markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Edit the markdown file to make your desired changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you dont know which article corresponds to a specific markdown file, simply use the `Edit this page` button at the end of every article.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Creating an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a new article:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Add the new article to the `sidebar.json` file. This will add it to the navigation sidebar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAwesome! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve successfully added new content to the docs \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBut keep in mind, building good documentation can be a challenging task and yet...surprisingly straightforward. The reason is simple: it is hard to write educational material, but it is very simple to evaluate its usefulness. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis guide on ***[The Art of Writing good Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYNNlqu36-k44LN86KL8332ldAlgr84ql_2lcnyRYW8/edit?usp=sharing  )*** will give you the right mindset to keep throughout your creative process: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Tool Developers***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a tool developer, you can contribute by:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Creating documentation for your tool and other tools used in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Standardizing repositories\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Contributing to typedocs and READMEs to enhance the usability of NEAR tools.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Specific Tasks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor a list of specific tasks to work on, refer to this [***LINK***](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1SK-a50ZZBEG_RU6Je04CeVlr23bjodS65jz_EJDKiUo/mobilebasic).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Your contributions play a vital role in improving NEAR documentation and making it more accessible to everyone***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Get Involved \\\\\\\\u{1f3c6}\"}, {\"id\": \"5dhk1o\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Documentation Updates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"## Feb 16th 2024 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.
