Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem.

If you are working on a NEAR ecosystem common goods projects and seeking funding from DevHub, this guide will serve as a helpful resource. DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and fostering a decentralized NEAR developer ecosystem. Our platform connects individuals, organizations, and projects, allowing them to propose their ideas and connect with potential sponsors. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## DevDAO Funding \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Guidelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO is the primary organization behind DevHub, and we offer sponsorships to contributors and projects that align with our goal of fostering a self-sufficient community of developers for a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open-source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its success. Below are examples of categories we support:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Content (podcasts, guides, tutorials)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Developer Tooling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Developer Relations (repos, documentation, community calls, social channel support)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Strategic Initiatives (zero knowledge)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Events & Local Presence (meetups, hackathons, brand-focused events)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Education (campus)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marketing & Branding (marketing materials, swag) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO supports a broad diversity of ideas. But as a general principle, we look for contributions that provide value to the NEAR developer community in meaningful ways. When evaluating proposals, we encourage applicants to consider the following key criteria:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Funding Process\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves several key stages that the applicant should consider:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Ideation**: Post your idea on DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s activity feed and request feedback from the community. At this point, you do not need to provide specific details for all the activities but an overall proposal description with an optional preliminary budget (see funding considerations).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Application**: Once an idea is validated by the community, post a solution on DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s activity feed, referencing the original idea post. In this submission, include detailed information about the activities you seek funding for and the amount of funding required (see funding considerations). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Community Review**: Proposals are open for community comments and attestations. DevDAO Moderators evaluate proposals on a rolling basis that align with DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s mission and focus areas. The moderators may coordinate and consult with communities and working groups covering multiple technical and operational areas such as infrastructure, zero knowledge, documentation, among many others.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Funding Approval**: DevDAO Moderators collate reviews from evaluations and community feedback, and is ultimately responsible for making a final decision to approve/reject proposal based on the evaluation criterias and factors such as priorities, budget limitations, and risks.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Payment Processing**: Once your proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will reply with a sponsorship post and contact you with the next steps, including KYC clearance, invoicing, and disbursement of funds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding\"}, {\"id\": \"p6oi6p\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\":

To get started, all you need is some spare time, a computer with Node.js installed, and a GitHub account.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## New to NEAR?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re new in the ecosystem, consider contributing by choosing a specific topic and following the documentation from start to finish. For instance, you can go through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"building smart contracts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" docs and take notes on any areas where you face challenges\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA web developer with real world experience in building applications (specially backend technologies) should be able to go through the docs. If you have such expertise and do not manage to understand the docs, then you have found a documentation problem! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, reach out through Telegram or Discord to seek clarification and then contribute by improving the docs to benefit others with your newfound knowledge.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Forking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a local instance of the docs: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Fork the official docs repository \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. Navigate to the `website` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. Install all dependencies by running (`npm install`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. Start a local version of the docs by running (`npm start`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Modifying an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Locate the relevant markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Edit the markdown file to make your desired changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you dont know which article corresponds to a specific markdown file, simply use the `Edit this page` button at the end of every article.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Creating an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a new article:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Add the new article to the `sidebar.json` file. This will add it to the navigation sidebar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAwesome! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve successfully added new content to the docs \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBut keep in mind, building good documentation can be a challenging task and yet...surprisingly straightforward. The reason is simple: it is hard to write educational material, but it is very simple to evaluate its usefulness. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis guide on ***[The Art of Writing good Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYNNlqu36-k44LN86KL8332ldAlgr84ql_2lcnyRYW8/edit?usp=sharing  )*** will give you the right mindset to keep throughout your creative process: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Tool Developers***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a tool developer, you can contribute by:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Creating documentation for your tool and other tools used in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Standardizing repositories\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Contributing to typedocs and READMEs to enhance the usability of NEAR tools.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Specific Tasks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor a list of specific tasks to work on, refer to this [***LINK***](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1SK-a50ZZBEG_RU6Je04CeVlr23bjodS65jz_EJDKiUo/mobilebasic).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n***Your contributions play a vital role in improving NEAR documentation and making it more accessible to everyone***\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Get Involved \\\\\\\\u{1f3c6}\"}], \"admins\": [\"bo.near\", \"bucanero.near\", \"gagdiez.near\", \"victorkanu1.near\", \"bpolania.near\"], \"handle\": \"documentation\", \"logo_url\": \"https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreidr2apd44pd7r2t5du6mjtjatuygvy2y2c6fmagn4c53vdzocyi6m\", \"banner_url\": \"https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreigdmw3m4reb4nmlmqq4p4flq465ryhh3tpr2wkp7zl6uljnc5tsoe\", \"description\": \"Participate in creating and maintaining NEAR docs\", \"website_url\": null, \"bio_markdown\": \"Community to discuss everything about NEAR developer documentation\", \"github_handle\": \"near/docs\", \"twitter_handle\": null, \"telegram_handle\": \"neardocscg\"}}"
