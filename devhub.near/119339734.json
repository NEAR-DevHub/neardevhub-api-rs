[https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/pull/772](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/pull/772)     | Various attempts on improving performance, but found that the main issue is when the number of blog posts grows big. Increasing debouncing on the input helps, so that typing does not trigger a search/rerender on every keypress. The current solution with all blog posts in memory does not scale, and some indexing is needed if there are many blog posts.Made the debounce timeout configurable on input, and increased it for blog search so that typing the search criteria does not lag.

the number of blog posts grows big. Increasing debouncing on the input helps, so that typing does not trigger a search/rerender on every keypress. The current solution with all blog posts in memory does not scale, and some indexing is needed if there are many blog posts.Made the debounce timeout configurable on input, and increased it for blog search so that typing the search criteria does not lag.
