Proposals are flowing timely. New T&C have been implemented eliminating the need to create Ironclad contracts.  This along with eliminating the KYC/B steps during the payment process, will drastically cut down on the steps necessary and the staff necessary to process a proposal payment.  Any proposals with a number after #144 will be processed in this new way.  Any proposals with a number prior to #144 will be processed the old way, i.e. creating the Ironclad agreement.  Ori and I are now working on how or if the Treasury system is implemented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are:\\\\\\\\n5 proposals in CRM that are from the old system showing as Invoice Pending that are still in the resolution stage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal hours: 17.5\\\\\\\\nRate: $80/hour\\\\\\\\nRate determination is below the low end of the average hourly contract rate ($87 - $162) for an accountant with the same years of experience. That average rate does not account for my 5 years of blockchain specific experience. I\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not fulfilling all the duties that typically fall under this type of role, that is why I proposed a rate lower than the low end of the average.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/controller-hourly-wages\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"9bd73bc9ba6ff289e2deb597dd6fe83dc0056af7a2937d6dec119660ba0146a4\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"theori.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"1400\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"tfdevhub.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
