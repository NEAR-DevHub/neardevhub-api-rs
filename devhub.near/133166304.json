I believe this is because of the use of a number array for the contract bytes ( would probably work if it was a base64 string ). Not sure yet how to reduce the contract size, and what the limit actually is here when deploying this way. Deploying to a subaccount does not have this limitation.                                                                                                                                                                             |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 1      | Sync                                         |                                                                                                                                                | Weekly sync call                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 2      | Treasury factory                             | [https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115) | Reduce web4 contract size, use linkdrop contract with base64 for uploading contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal hours: 61\\\\\\\\nHourly rate (USD): $150\\\\\\\\nTotal requested amount (USD): 9150\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"petersalomonsen.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"9150\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": [], \"accepted_terms_and_conditions_version\": 133224651}"

I believe this is because of the use of a number array for the contract bytes ( would probably work if it was a base64 string ). Not sure yet how to reduce the contract size, and what the limit actually is here when deploying this way. Deploying to a subaccount does not have this limitation.                                                                                                                                                                             |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 1      | Sync                                         |                                                                                                                                                | Weekly sync call                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 2      | Treasury factory                             | [https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115) | Reduce web4 contract size, use linkdrop contract with base64 for uploading contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal hours: 61\\\\\\\\nHourly rate (USD): $150\\\\\\\\nTotal requested amount (USD): 9150\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"petersalomonsen.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"9150\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"author_id\": \"petersalomonsen.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"

I believe this is because of the use of a number array for the contract bytes ( would probably work if it was a base64 string ). Not sure yet how to reduce the contract size, and what the limit actually is here when deploying this way. Deploying to a subaccount does not have this limitation.                                                                                                                                                                             |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 1      | Sync                                         |                                                                                                                                                | Weekly sync call                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\\\\\\\\n| 2024-11-20 | 2      | Treasury factory                             | [https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard/pull/115) | Reduce web4 contract size, use linkdrop contract with base64 for uploading contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTotal hours: 61\\\\\\\\nHourly rate (USD): $150\\\\\\\\nTotal requested amount (USD): 9150\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"petersalomonsen.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"9150\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"USDC\"}, \"labels\": []}"
