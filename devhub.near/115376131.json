By collaborating on the developer productivity tools for NEAR\\\\\\\\u{2019}s Blockchain Operating System [BOS], Zero Knowledge [ZK], and Smart Contracts, community members can foster innovation and enrich our developer community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Why is it needed?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs the NEAR ecosystem grows rapidly, there is an increasing need to improve developer productivity. While open-source communities are essential to manage these needs, new developers may find it challenging to get started. The DevDAO NEAR Platform Fellowship Program aims to solve this issue by providing guidance to new contributors from experienced developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### What are the focus areas?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO focuses on improving work in the following strategic areas within the NEAR ecosystem:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Blockchain Operating System implementation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Zero Knowledge SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- JavaScript on-chain and off-chain SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Rust on-chain and off-chain SDK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Mobile development (native iOS/Android, and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWithin each area, there are a number of tasks to complete, including developing security and contract development toolkits, creating productivity tools, and maintaining open-source repositories. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO wants to prioritize contributions to the following repositories: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [docs](https://github.com/near/docs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-api-js](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-jsonrpc-client-rs](https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-sdk-rs](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [near-sdk-js](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [workspaces-rs](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [workspaces-js](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [wallet-selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [create-near-app](https://github.com/near/create-near-app)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How does it work?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO\\\\\\\\\\\\'s NEAR Platform Fellowship Program is a way for active and experienced NEAR developers to empower new contributors and solve the focus areas above. Here\\\\\\\\u{2019}s it works: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Apply**: Experienced contributors apply to become a Fellowship Leader by submitting a proposal on DevHub. The proposal must include a timeline, budget to allocate to new contributors, and a focus area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Approve**: DevDAO and the NEAR community review the proposal to ensure that it aligns with the NEAR community goals and that the budget is reasonable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Invite**: Upon acceptance, the Fellowship Leader invites new contributors to participate in the project. The Fellowship Leader is responsible for evaluating and negotiating compensation (see [funding guidelines](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/near-developer-governance-funding-guidelines)) with the new contributors. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Execute**: Once the team is assembled, they can begin working on the project. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Compensate**: Once the work is complete, contributors submit their contribution report on DevHub. The Fellowship Leader must provide an attestation to confirm the work and compensation amount. DevDAO will then work to issue the payment.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo help bootstrap the program, DevDAO invites experienced developers to apply from various expert entities such as Pagoda, Aurora, Proximity, Human Guild, and Calimero. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to submit a fellowship proposal?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSubmit a fellowship proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](http://neardevhub.org) using these guidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create a new \\\\\\\\u{201c}Solution\\\\\\\\u{201d} post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship\\\\\\\\u{201d} and \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship-proposal\\\\\\\\u{201d} labels to your post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Provide a clear description of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Describe the skills and experience you are looking for from new contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Set a budget for your fellowship using the [funding guidelines](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/near-developer-governance-funding-guidelines). Note that the compensation will get paid directly from DevDAO to contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce you have submitted your proposal, the DevDAO team will review it and provide feedback. If your proposal is approved, you can start recruiting fellow contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to be a great fellowship leader?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs a Fellowship Leader, your role is crucial in empowering successful contributions to our ecosystem. To be an effective leader, it is essential to perform several key tasks:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Define the scope of work**: Submit a well-defined proposal with clear goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Find contributors**: Utilize networking, various community groups, and applications left on DevHub as comments to your proposal to find contributors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Onboard contributors**: Set clear expectations, including your availability and communication guidelines. Additionally, provide well-defined tasks with the relevant context and acceptance criteria.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Oversee execution**: Deliver quality results that meet the needs of our ecosystem by monitoring the project, providing feedback to contributors, and promptly responding to questions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to be a great contributor?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNew contributors play an essential role in our ecosystem, bringing fresh perspectives and ideas. If you\\\\\\\\u{2019}re looking to make meaningful contributions and gain guidance from experienced developers, here are some tips to help you get started:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Apply to a fellowship**: Find [available fellowship proposals on NEAR DevHub](/devhub.near/widget/app?page=feed&tag=fellowship-proposal) and leave a comment with your application for a project that interests you.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Align with your Fellowship Leader**: If you are selected, it is important to align with your Fellowship Leader on the expectations and requirements for the project.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Be self-sufficient**: While your Fellowship Leader is there to guide you, it is important to become self-sufficient quickly and focus on completing your work. This means taking initiative to learn and communicating when you need support.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Provide updates**: Post a contribution report on DevHub to provide transparency and potentially to get compensated.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Keep improving**: As you gain more knowledge and experience, we hope that you continue to contribute to our ecosystem and share your insights to enable others to contribute too.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to submit a contribution report?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, DevDAO requires all contributors to submit a contribution report on the [NEAR DevHub](http://neardevhub.org) once the work is complete using these guidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create a new \\\\\\\\u{201c}Solution\\\\\\\\u{201d} post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\u{201c}fellowship\\\\\\\\u{201d} and \\\\\\\\u{201c}contribution-report\\\\\\\\u{201d} labels to your post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add the requested compensation amount\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- In the description, reference the relevant fellowship proposal post. And list your contributions with references (e.g. PRs, issues, etc), the time spent, and [the factors to consider when determining the compensation amount](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/near-developer-governance-funding-guidelines).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce you have submitted your contribution report, your Fellowship Leader must reply to it with an attestation confirming that the report is accurate and that they are offering a certain amount of their pre-approved budget.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO will keep track of the attestations and take appropriate action to approve the payment unless there are any concerns raised.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### What does DevDAO expect in the short term?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOver the next three months, DevDAO aims to board 10 fellowship leaders who will help us establish and scale this program. We welcome feedback from the community, so please share your thoughts by replying to this post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about the DevDAO goals, check out [the recently posted OKRs](/#/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=531). Together, we can build a community where developers share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"About\"}}"

Here are major worth noting ones.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Guide to nearcore development](https://near.github.io/nearcore/index.html): Explains how each part of nearcore operates, e.g. how state sync, garbage collection, epoch works, how storage layer interacts with the layers on top, etc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Nomicon](https://nomicon.io/): Near protocol specification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near nodes](https://near-nodes.io/): Explains how near node works and how one can become a node operator \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near doc](https://docs.near.org/develop/welcome): Walks you through on how to develop on top of NEAR protocol, e.g. how to build a smart contract on NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn): Learn Rust, the programming language NEAR protocol is written in\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"About Us\"}, {\"id\": \"730ru7\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to contribute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Protocol community group runs various events and programs you can participate in to improve NEAR blockchain. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Virtual meet ups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nStay up-to-date on upcoming and past events in the NEAR protocol space. Whether it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a monthly community call, hackathon, or meetup, you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll find the details here to connect with other community members.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCurrently, we have two periodic virtual meetups, one for general community group and another for working group.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Community Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Protocol Community Group hosts a monthly call to connect, share ideas or concerns, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the NEAR protocol.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to join the call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFind out about the latest meetings below or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Who can attend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnyone is welcome to attend the monthly call. Whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re an individual, organization, or an expert in the NEAR Protocol, it is open to all. Each call is recorded and posted on this page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Format\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe monthly call is a free-format discussion with basic moderation. Anyone can volunteer to facilitate and lead future calls. The agenda typically starts with introductions from participants and follows with a list of potential discussion topics. The group will prioritize the topics based on what participants want to discuss the most. Topics may include updates from various members on any developments or initiatives, presentations on the latest research, as well as open discussion from questions and ideas to challenges and opportunities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Work Group Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMostly, Protocol Working group reviews and discusses NEP asynchronously within the NEP\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public thread. This allows for broad participation and ensures transparency.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, if a discussion becomes circular and could benefit from a synchronous conversation, the Protocol Working Group may host public formal calls to review specific proposals, discuss attestations, or vote on decisions. For example, if a reviewer and author have multiple rounds of comments, they may request a call. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Monthly protocol engineer virtual meetup day\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce a month, protocol engineers meet virtually on [Gather town](https://app.gather.town/app) to simulate \\\\\\\\u{2018}office working environment\\\\\\\\u{2019} by presenting in the virtual workspace during their work hours. By doing so, we encourage adhoc discussions and conversations to build stronger relationships and maximize our creativity. During this day, we also host a social hour so we can have fun activities together as well.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nVirtual working day schedule is shared on [Zulip general stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/virtual.20meetup.20day)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Bug bounty program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBug bounty program is to leverage power of community to make NEAR protocol more secure and fraud-proof. If you notice any issues that can be a threat to our users on nearcore repo, please report them and claim the bounty! Please follow the [LINK](https://hackenproof.com/near/near-protocol) to Hacken proof Near protocol page to know more about the program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Funding Proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have the idea that can make NEAR protocol more scalable/reliable/secure, you can submit a proposal to get funding for your precious time and effort. Currently, NEAR DevDAO is running the funding program by collaborating with Protocol working group. Once a proposal is submitted, DevDAO will work with Protocol working group to determine the necessity of the project by thoroughly reviewing the proposal. Once conclusion is made, DevDAO will reach out to the proposer to share the final decision and work with them on the next step.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about the guidelines and how to submit a proposal for funding, please visit [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=developer-dao&tab=funding). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### How to participate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThere are several ways to participate in community activities.

All contributors to nearcore repository, including [Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/) protocol team members, are implicit members of the community, and actively participate in community discussions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Protocol Community Group TG Channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Ongoing projects\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Protocol roadmap](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/q1-protocol-roadmap-update-progress-and-changes-e2d61626e4a1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Github \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [Major projects](https://github.com/near/nearcore/labels/C-tracking-issue)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [Discussions](https://github.com/near/nearcore/discussions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  * [PRs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pulls)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Sponsored projects](https://near.social/#/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.Sponsorship?label=protocol)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Communication channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Attend periodic Protocol community group calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295558-pagoda.2Fcore)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Documents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nProtocol community maintains several documents/wikis so community members can stay informative and efficient to find what they are seeking for. Here are major worth noting ones.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Guide to nearcore development](https://near.github.io/nearcore/index.html): Explains how each part of nearcore operates, e.g. how state sync, garbage collection, epoch works, how storage layer interacts with the layers on top, etc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Nomicon](https://nomicon.io/): Near protocol specification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near nodes](https://near-nodes.io/): Explains how near node works and how one can become a node operator \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Near doc](https://docs.near.org/develop/welcome): Walks you through on how to develop on top of NEAR protocol, e.g. how to build a smart contract on NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn): Learn Rust, the programming language NEAR protocol is written in\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"About Us\"}, {\"id\": \"730ru7\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to contribute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"subtitle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Protocol community group runs various events and programs you can participate in to improve NEAR blockchain. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Virtual meet ups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nStay up-to-date on upcoming and past events in the NEAR protocol space. Whether it\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a monthly community call, hackathon, or meetup, you\\\\\\\\u{2019}ll find the details here to connect with other community members.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCurrently, we have two periodic virtual meetups, one for general community group and another for working group.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Community Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Protocol Community Group hosts a monthly call to connect, share ideas or concerns, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the NEAR protocol.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### How to join the call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFind out about the latest meetings below or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/NEAR_Protocol_Community_Group).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Who can attend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnyone is welcome to attend the monthly call. Whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re an individual, organization, or an expert in the NEAR Protocol, it is open to all. Each call is recorded and posted on this page.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Format\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe monthly call is a free-format discussion with basic moderation. Anyone can volunteer to facilitate and lead future calls. The agenda typically starts with introductions from participants and follows with a list of potential discussion topics. The group will prioritize the topics based on what participants want to discuss the most. Topics may include updates from various members on any developments or initiatives, presentations on the latest research, as well as open discussion from questions and ideas to challenges and opportunities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Work Group Calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMostly, Protocol Working group reviews and discusses NEP asynchronously within the NEP\\\\\\\\u{2019}s public thread. This allows for broad participation and ensures transparency.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, if a discussion becomes circular and could benefit from a synchronous conversation, the Protocol Working Group may host public formal calls to review specific proposals, discuss attestations, or vote on decisions. For example, if a reviewer and author have multiple rounds of comments, they may request a call. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Monthly protocol engineer virtual meetup day\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce a month, protocol engineers meet virtually on [Gather town](https://app.gather.town/app) to simulate \\\\\\\\u{2018}office working environment\\\\\\\\u{2019} by presenting in the virtual workspace during their work hours. By doing so, we encourage adhoc discussions and conversations to build stronger relationships and maximize our creativity. During this day, we also host a social hour so we can have fun activities together as well.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nVirtual working day schedule is shared on [Zulip general stream](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/virtual.20meetup.20day)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Bug bounty program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBug bounty program is to leverage power of community to make NEAR protocol more secure and fraud-proof. If you notice any issues that can be a threat to our users on nearcore repo, please report them and claim the bounty! Please follow the [LINK](https://hackenproof.com/near/near-protocol) to Hacken proof Near protocol page to know more about the program\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n------\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Funding Proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have the idea that can make NEAR protocol more scalable/reliable/secure, you can submit a proposal to get funding for your precious time and effort. Currently, NEAR DevDAO is running the funding program by collaborating with Protocol working group. Once a proposal is submitted, DevDAO will work with Protocol working group to determine the necessity of the project by thoroughly reviewing the proposal. Once conclusion is made, DevDAO will reach out to the proposer to share the final decision and work with them on the next step.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about the guidelines and how to submit a proposal for funding, please visit [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=developer-dao&tab=funding). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### How to participate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThere are several ways to participate in community activities.
