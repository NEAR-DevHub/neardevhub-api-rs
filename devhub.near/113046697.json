We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Mission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Vision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Example areas of involvement include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Roles & Responsibilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Sponsorships\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there\\\\\\\\u{2019}s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/devgov-dao-staking-pool-announcement), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe use the [NEAR Dev Hub](https://neardevhub.org/) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The Funding Board shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our funding guidelines.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Overview\"}, {\"id\": \"2te4j0\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\": \"wiki\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to get help\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Welcome to DevHub!

If you are working on a NEAR ecosystem common goods projects and seeking funding from DevHub, this guide will serve as a helpful resource. DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and fostering a decentralized NEAR developer ecosystem. Our platform connects individuals, organizations, and projects, allowing them to propose their ideas and connect with potential sponsors. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## DevDAO Funding \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Guidelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO is the primary organization behind DevHub, and we offer sponsorships to contributors and projects that align with our goal of fostering a self-sufficient community of developers for a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Areas of Funding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe are building an open-source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its success. Below are examples of categories we support:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Content (podcasts, guides, tutorials)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Developer Tooling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Developer Relations (repos, documentation, community calls, social channel support)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Strategic Initiatives (zero knowledge)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Events & Local Presence (meetups, hackathons, brand-focused events)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Education (campus)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Marketing & Branding (marketing materials, swag) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Evaluation Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevDAO supports a broad diversity of ideas. But as a general principle, we look for contributions that provide value to the NEAR developer community in meaningful ways. When evaluating proposals, we encourage applicants to consider the following key criteria:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Developer First**: We strongly support proposals that prioritize the needs of developers and help growth and retain the number of active developers on NEAR. Show us how your solution will make it easy for developers to succeed, whether through tools, libraries, education, or other initiatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Open Source**: Not all proposals require code, but they should follow the spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Public Good**: We want to see clear benefits to the NEAR & broader community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Execution Ability**: Demonstrate your ability to to deliver by sharing your team\\\\\\\\u{2019}s track record of success and available resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* **Clear Use of Funds**: We expect to carefully consider the factors that influence your funding amount request and present clearly how the funding will enable your goals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Funding Process\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe funding of projects is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, various Work Groups in the community, and the DevDAO Moderators. It involves several key stages that the applicant should consider:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Ideation**: Post your idea on DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s activity feed and request feedback from the community. At this point, you do not need to provide specific details for all the activities but an overall proposal description with an optional preliminary budget (see funding considerations).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Application**: Once an idea is validated by the community, post a solution on DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s activity feed, referencing the original idea post. In this submission, include detailed information about the activities you seek funding for and the amount of funding required (see funding considerations). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Community Review**: Proposals are open for community comments and attestations. DevDAO Moderators evaluate proposals on a rolling basis that align with DevHub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s mission and focus areas. The moderators may coordinate and consult with communities and working groups covering multiple technical and operational areas such as infrastructure, zero knowledge, documentation, among many others.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Funding Approval**: DevDAO Moderators collate reviews from evaluations and community feedback, and is ultimately responsible for making a final decision to approve/reject proposal based on the evaluation criterias and factors such as priorities, budget limitations, and risks.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Payment Processing**: Once your proposal is approved, DevDAO Moderators will reply with a sponsorship post and contact you with the next steps, including KYC clearance, invoicing, and disbursement of funds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"textAlign\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\", \"display_name\": \"Funding\"}, {\"id\": \"p6oi6p\", \"enabled\": true, \"addon_id\":
