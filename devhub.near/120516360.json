This release allows developers to leverage Roketo Business UI components in their projects and contribute to the toolkit\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ongoing development.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - **Link**: [GitHub Repo - Roketo Business UI](https://github.com/roke-to/roketo-business-ui)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n15. **Discussion on Wallet Selector Dependency:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCommunity members discussed the need to update dependencies in the wallet selector tool to avoid hindering developer productivity. This discussion emphasized the importance of keeping tooling infrastructure up-to-date to support ongoing development efforts in the NEAR ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n16. **Challenge with DelegateAction Export:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers encountered a challenge with exporting `DelegateAction` from the `near_primitives::transactions` module and discussed plans to address it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n17. **Prompting for Missing CLI Command Arguments:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDevelopers discussed the idea of prompting users for missing CLI command arguments to enhance usability and streamline the command-line interface experience. This enhancement would improve user interaction with CLI commands and reduce the likelihood of errors due to missing arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n18. **Introducing Cross shard congestion control**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our recent Protocol Work Group call #10, we discussed and voted on NEP-522 and NEP-539. NEP-522, which proposed a solution to address nonce conflicts in NEAR transactions, was rejected as it did not pass the subject matter reviews.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the other hand, NEP-539, which introduces a congestion control mechanism to manage increased network usage and congestion on specific shards, received strong support from all work group members and is leaning towards approval.

The goal is to encourage broad innovation from the developer community without relying on a single entity. This opens the door for anyone to participate and contribute in any capacity in a transparent and permissionless way, while ensuring quality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many ways to engage with developer governance. Almost any type of developer community activity falls under one of four categories:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreihdce75h4zzarrorgazcoh6wjb4qyoy65d5x7ymqvvc2xtdqknuwi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*For example, Alice starts with an idea and bounces her thoughts in some community channel about it. This group gives her social validation and helps hone her idea, enough for her to start planning implementation. At some point she might choose to validate her plan with subject matter experts, to ensure other products agree to integrate with her tech, to rally more community behind it, to seek funding, or to simply strengthen her pitch. One of the acceleration and funding programs passes by and decides to fund and enable her project based on her strong plan and community support.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis simple story does not describe all the options available to Alice. If she has a solution already fully figured out in her mind, she might choose to implement it without announcing it or seeking validation, or to fundraise entirely on her own. Also, her idea might not have anything to do with writing code. Perhaps she is offering to review or audit someone else\\\\\\\\u{2019}s project, or to organize a technical event, etc. Regardless of what she chooses to do and not do, there are four categories of developer community activity she can choose to engage with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeveloper Governance is both a decentralized social structure and a set of tools. As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Ideate\\\\\\\\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way. But people cannot be just thrusted into general purpose chats where their ideas are buried in the noise and where it is hard to discover like-minded people. Based on our experience in other Open Source communities, we adopted the concept of a Community Group (CG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a self-organized circle of people interested in a specific topic. CGs are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them and anyone can create a CG with the specialization they want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in ideation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubmit your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Join an existing [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) and discuss ideas\\\\\\\\n- Start a new [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Implement\\\\\\\\nCoding is the defining feature of the development community, and we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want to create any barriers in the way of community members who just want to write some code. We recognize that sometimes coding is done in response to some idea and that people can discover ideas as the result of coding. However, we want the coding to be inclusive and therefore if you want to submit your implementation specification, you first need to describe an idea even if it is vague. In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\\\\\\\\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Review\\\\\\\\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone\\\\\\\\u{2019}s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. \\\\\\\\u{201c}wg-protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\\\\\\\\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Support \\\\\\\\n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects. NEAR Foundation, NDC, and various accelerators have different criteria and motivation to sponsor and support ecosystem projects. However, they don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have resources to review all applications and oversee proper utilization of funds. While we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want our developer community to be centered around funding, we want to make funding as easy as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSponsors can quickly explore projects matching their criteria by using filtering with labels (coming soon) and checking out the attestations submitted by the experts, e.g. Work Groups. They can also request reviews from WG in the comments of the ideas and submissions. Once they find projects that are matching their criteria, they can negotiate the cost in the comments or delegate it to the Work Group experts. Finally, they can submit a sponsorship with and designate an expert to supervise funds utilization, which might require paying them a fee. is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects.

As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Ideate\\\\\\\\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way.

The goal is to encourage broad innovation from the developer community without relying on a single entity. This opens the door for anyone to participate and contribute in any capacity in a transparent and permissionless way, while ensuring quality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many ways to engage with developer governance. Almost any type of developer community activity falls under one of four categories:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreihdce75h4zzarrorgazcoh6wjb4qyoy65d5x7ymqvvc2xtdqknuwi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*For example, Alice starts with an idea and bounces her thoughts in some community channel about it. This group gives her social validation and helps hone her idea, enough for her to start planning implementation. At some point she might choose to validate her plan with subject matter experts, to ensure other products agree to integrate with her tech, to rally more community behind it, to seek funding, or to simply strengthen her pitch. One of the acceleration and funding programs passes by and decides to fund and enable her project based on her strong plan and community support.*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis simple story does not describe all the options available to Alice. If she has a solution already fully figured out in her mind, she might choose to implement it without announcing it or seeking validation, or to fundraise entirely on her own. Also, her idea might not have anything to do with writing code. Perhaps she is offering to review or audit someone else\\\\\\\\u{2019}s project, or to organize a technical event, etc. Regardless of what she chooses to do and not do, there are four categories of developer community activity she can choose to engage with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDeveloper Governance is both a decentralized social structure and a set of tools. As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Ideate\\\\\\\\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way. But people cannot be just thrusted into general purpose chats where their ideas are buried in the noise and where it is hard to discover like-minded people. Based on our experience in other Open Source communities, we adopted the concept of a Community Group (CG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a self-organized circle of people interested in a specific topic. CGs are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them and anyone can create a CG with the specialization they want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in ideation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubmit your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Join an existing [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) and discuss ideas\\\\\\\\n- Start a new [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Implement\\\\\\\\nCoding is the defining feature of the development community, and we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want to create any barriers in the way of community members who just want to write some code. We recognize that sometimes coding is done in response to some idea and that people can discover ideas as the result of coding. However, we want the coding to be inclusive and therefore if you want to submit your implementation specification, you first need to describe an idea even if it is vague. In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\\\\\\\\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Review\\\\\\\\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) \\\\\\\\u{2013} a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone\\\\\\\\u{2019}s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. \\\\\\\\u{201c}wg-protocol\\\\\\\\u{201d}\\\\\\\\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\\\\\\\\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Support \\\\\\\\n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects. NEAR Foundation, NDC, and various accelerators have different criteria and motivation to sponsor and support ecosystem projects. However, they don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t have resources to review all applications and oversee proper utilization of funds. While we don\\\\\\\\u{2019}t want our developer community to be centered around funding, we want to make funding as easy as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSponsors can quickly explore projects matching their criteria by using filtering with labels (coming soon) and checking out the attestations submitted by the experts, e.g. Work Groups.

Moreover, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a robust method to assess support from a spectrum of stakeholders. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The Ideation Process \\\\\\\\u{1f4a1}\\\\\\\\nBefore you dive into the funding aspect of your collaboration with DevHub, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with this ideation process. If you need help figuring out where to begin, we\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve covered you with this insightful post: [How to Ideate on DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have already nurtured and refined your idea, you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready to draft and post your funding proposal. We understand that this might seem daunting. But remember, this is your chance to transform your idea into reality and showcase its value and potential to the world. This guide is here to help you craft a compelling, convincing, and concise proposal that will capture the interest of potential funders. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s embark on this journey together, turning your secret into a shared vision that others are enthusiastic about investing in.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Posting on DevHub \\\\\\\\u{1f4dd}\\\\\\\\nBefore you start writing your proposal, visit our [forum](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Spend some time exploring existing proposals and ideas. This will help you understand the format and style of successful proposals and ascertain if your idea aligns with the typically funded projects. Once you are ready to post, press the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Post\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" button at the top of the feed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie5vmzqkcopiythranbzusjnky6p6jiv7mvsk7vetas726c2j77mu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you should see a form. This is your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s primary source of truth, so let\\\\\\\\u{2019}s look so you understand what we expect to see there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Understanding Markdown \\\\\\\\u{1f468}\\\\\\\\u{1f4bb}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you begin crafting your proposal, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to note that our forum requires submissions to be formatted using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax designed for formatting text on the web. It allows you to control the display of the document by adding simple symbols and characters to your text. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith Markdown, you can create headings, bold or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"italic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" text, add links, insert images, and more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, to make a text bold in Markdown, you would wrap the text in two asterisks , and for a link, you would put the text of the link in brackets and the URL in parentheses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re new to Markdown or need a refresher, don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry. Many great resources are available online to help you understand and effectively use them. This [comprehensive guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a fantastic starting point for beginners. It walks you through the basics and gets progressively more detailed, allowing you to master Markdown at your own pace. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemember, the goal of using Markdown is to make your proposal clear, readable, and well-presented.

This should grab the attention of potential funders and make them want to know more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Description: \\\\\\\\nThis is the most crucial part of the proposal because it should contain all the information regarding the proposal, including timelines, milestones, costs, etc. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Begin your proposal with an introduction briefly overviewing your project. Describe the project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s objectives, your team, and why you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re passionate about it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Now, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to add a comprehensive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Summary of Activities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is where you outline all the activities you intend to carry out during your project\\\\\\\\\\\\'s duration. Where appropriate, categorize these activities into distinct sections. Each activity should have an associated timeframe, clearly indicating its estimated duration. This summary isn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t merely a formality\\\\\\\\u{2014}it serves a vital purpose in allowing the community to follow the progress of your proposal. Remember to use markdown to create all sections, links, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a first-time poster or a regular forum participant, or even if this proposal builds on previous ones, remember to include links to related past proposals. These links provide crucial context and history for your current project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis section also serves as a resource hub for your proposal. It\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the ideal spot to include any additional material that may strengthen your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s case: links to external resources, relevant documentation, explanatory videos, etc. All these materials can enrich your proposal and aid in the review process, making it easier to understand and evaluate your project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Specify a timeline so your proposal\\\\\\\\\\\\'s start and end dates are precise. This allows funders to understand the timeline for your project and when they can expect to see results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Finally, you must specify the particularities of the funding you are requesting and your **justification** (see [factors](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036) to consider). Are you calculating the amount on an hourly basis? If so, how many hours a week, day, or month? What is the hourly or daily rate? Is it milestone based? What part of the funding corresponds to each milestone?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n##### Labels:\\\\\\\\nThis is an optional field that can be left empty, but we encourage you to include any community labels that fit the nature of the proposal.

Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re satisfied with how your proposal looks, hit \\\\\\\\\\\\'Submit.\\\\\\\\\\\\' and Congratulations! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve posted your funding proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What Happens Next? \\\\\\\\u{1f647}\\\\\\\\nNow that your proposal has been posted, a few things must happen before you get funded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Amplify:** The appropriate team or community may give feedback to support or reject your proposal. The author\\\\\\\\u{2019}s responsible for getting social support or requesting expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant community groups or individuals. Also, stay active on the forum and respond to any questions or feedback from potential funders. This engagement will show your commitment and may increase your chances of securing funding. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Approval:** If a sponsor such as DevHub decides to approve the proposal, they will reply with a sponsorship post and provide more details about the next steps, such as the KYC process and how to proceed with the payment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### What if my proposal is rejected? \\\\\\\\u{1f62f}\\\\\\\\nEven with the best preparation and utmost clarity, there may be instances when a proposal gets rejected. If you find yourself in this situation, we urge you not to be discouraged. Remember, each rejection is an opportunity for learning and improvement. Take the time to understand the feedback provided, evaluate your proposal, and identify areas that can be strengthened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse this setback as fuel to refine your proposal and make it more compelling. Engage with the community, ask questions, seek advice, and don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hesitate to iterate on your ideas. A proposal rejection is not a judgment on your idea\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth or potential but rather an invitation to look at it from a different perspective and make it even more robust.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if your proposal doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get approved on the first try, take a deep breath and prepare to dive back in. Remember, every successful innovator has faced rejection, and your determination and resilience will ultimately turn your vision into a reality. We look forward to your revised proposal and applaud your courage and persistence in bringing your idea to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Decentralizing success \\\\\\\\u{1f31f}\\\\\\\\nPosting your funding proposal on our DevHub forum is a systematic process that, when carefully followed, can significantly increase your chances of gaining the support and backing you need. Clarity, completeness, and enthusiasm are integral to a successful proposal, so this guide has provided a detailed roadmap from drafting and submitting your proposal and navigating the review and approval process. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, remember that a rejected proposal is not the end of the road. Instead, it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an opportunity for growth and refinement. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\'t retreat in the face of failure\\\\\\\\u{2014}welcome it, learn from it, and leverage it as your catalyst to bounce back stronger. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u{200d}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour tenacity and resilience will ultimately be the driving force behind your vision turning into reality.

In this post, we will take a closer look at who determines the funding at DevHub, what factors to consider when proposing the funding amount, and how to submit a funding request.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNEAR DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and empowering anyone to [contribute to the ecosystem](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028). A big part of this is providing financial support to some of the activities that go into bringing innovative projects to life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Who determines the funding\\\\\\\\nThe funding amount for a proposal is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, the Work Groups, and the Developer DAO moderators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt starts with the applicant figuring out the appropriate amount to ask for in their proposal based on factors such as project complexity, timeline, and skill levels. Once the applicant posts their proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), various Work Groups evaluate the technical and product aspects of the proposal within their area of expertise. They also assess the project cost considerations, and in some cases negotiate with the applicant. Since Work Groups specialize in different areas, their evaluation may vary. After the Work Groups provide their attestations, the Developer DAO moderators will consolidate the feedback and make the final funding decision. In some cases, the Developer DAO moderators may schedule a public call to meet with the applicant(s) to discuss or negotiate the proposal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### What factors to consider when determining the funding\\\\\\\\nAll parties mentioned above should use the following factors when determining the funding amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project complexity and duration: Consider the level of effort and the length of the project.\\\\\\\\n- Seniority and skill required for the task. Consider using [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) as a guideline to determine the expected hourly rate for each level of seniority and role.\\\\\\\\n- Temporary nature of the engagement: Adjust for the temporary nature of engagement. Since temporary engagements are less financially secure than full-time job positions, an extra 20-80% markup is potentially justifiable.\\\\\\\\n- Special skills or experience: If the project requires niche skills, such as a proven knowledge of NEAR protocol internals, a person with such skills can justify requesting more compensation.\\\\\\\\n- Economic circumstances: While it is difficult to apply geographic compensation calibration consistently in a blockchain space, it is also unfair to recognize that some teams might have a 4x lower cost of the workforce than other teams due to their geographic location. We expect applicants to be open about it and for Work Groups to enforce [geographic coefficients](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721125654/https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) when the disparity is drastic.\\\\\\\\n- Diversification of the NEAR ecosystem: It is in the interests of DevHub to support multiple entities with funding, rather than giving all grants to a single qualified party. Therefore, in some rare cases, funding may be granted to a party that is slightly less fit but is a newcomer to the ecosystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Submitting funding requests on the NEAR Dev Hub\\\\\\\\nThe best place to submit a funding request is through a solution post on [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). You must first create an [idea](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029) post, and reply to it with a solution post type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunding requests guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Project details: Include a clear overview of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\\\\\\\\n- Budget breakdown: To ensure transparency and increase the chances of approval, the applicant should include a budget breakdown with justification based on the various factors mentioned in the previous section.\\\\\\\\n- Timeline: Projects and their corresponding funding should have a short timeline, preferably under a month. This helps ensure project success by creating a clearly defined scope and minimizing risks. If a project has multiple milestones, propose each milestone as an independent funding request.\\\\\\\\n- Evaluation before funding: The bulk of the evaluation should happen before the project receives the funding. This helps to minimize the risks and ensure the project meets the desired goals.\", \"metadata\": {\"id\": \"2036\", \"title\": \"NEAR DevHub Funding Guidelines\", \"author\": \"bearmans.near\", \"status\": \"DRAFT\", \"category\": \"guide\", \"subtitle\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-11-29\", \"updatedAt\": \"2023-11-29\", \"description\": \"Factors to consider when requesting funds\", \"publishedAt\": \"2023-11-29\", \"communityAddonId\": \"blogv2\"}}}}, \"handle\": \"developer-dao\"}"
