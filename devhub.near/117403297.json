Reference to first proposal here:** https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=post&id=3043 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Overview:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUI is Near is not just a repository; it\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the go-to destination for unlocking a world of effortless design solutions for NEAR BOS. This project is designed to redefine the development experience by providing a comprehensive plug-and-play component library with crystal-clear documentation and thus, ease the entry barrier for new developers during hackathons and other onboarding activities, projects and events and also improve the development process for seasoned NEAR devs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Motivation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Our Motivation:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs active participants in numerous hackathons and contributors to NEAR\\\\\\\\\\\\'s thriving ecosystem, we couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\'t help but notice a shared sentiment within the developer community. We listened attentively to their discussions about NEAR, absorbing all the feels: their insights, frustrations, and aspirations. What did we find out? Despite the innovative potential and promising bounties offered by NEAR, some developers would stay on the fence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\\\\\u{2019}s when it hit us, everyone\\\\\\\\\\\\'s facing this same challenge: too much information, scattered and little to no clue of where to start. So we said, \\\\\\\\u{201c}They need something slick, easy, like a plug-and-play magic wand for developing, let\\\\\\\\\\\\'s make NEAR a no-brainer for every dev out there, from the code wizard to the hackathon hero!\\\\\\\\u{201d}. This is how the idea for UI is Near was born.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUI is Near serves as a solution crafted by developers for developers, driven by a genuine passion for making NEAR an irresistible choice for every developer, hackathon enthusiast, and project pioneer who want to build for the Open Web.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**A She is Near + Dev Hub initiative:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBuilt by the community of She is Near in collaboration with Dev Hub, UI is Near is our initiative for the NEAR Ecosystem. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis project aligns with both She is Near and NEAR Dev Hub core values and goals of onboarding new devs into the ecosystem and increasing retention while fostering an inclusive and supportive developer community that includes women of all backgrounds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key Features:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith a \\\\\\\\u{201c}for dummies\\\\\\\\u{201d} approach, we want to show devs how the components were built and also facilitate their styling. In other words, create the type of libraries that already exist in Web2 to facilitate onboarding and continuous work on Web3. A developer\\\\\\\\u{2019}s dream.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEntry point for Devs: UI is Near allows devs new to Near, whether at hackathons or other projects, programs or events, to focus on what matters most, accelerating the development process and enabling them to bring their ideas to life swiftly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustom Designed Components: Accessible and customizable UI is Near will offer 37 components designed to facilitate and enhance the visual appeal and functionality of front-ends built on BOS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## These components are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\naccordion\\\\\\\\nalert-dialog\\\\\\\\nalert\\\\\\\\naspect-ratio\\\\\\\\navatar\\\\\\\\nbadge\\\\\\\\nbutton\\\\\\\\ncard\\\\\\\\ncheckbox\\\\\\\\ncollapsible\\\\\\\\ncontext-menu\\\\\\\\ndialog\\\\\\\\ndropdown-menu\\\\\\\\nhover-card\\\\\\\\ninput\\\\\\\\nlabel\\\\\\\\nmenubar\\\\\\\\nnavigation-menu\\\\\\\\npagination\\\\\\\\npopover\\\\\\\\nprogress\\\\\\\\nradio-group\\\\\\\\nscroll-area\\\\\\\\nselect\\\\\\\\nseparator\\\\\\\\nsheet\\\\\\\\nskeleton\\\\\\\\nslider\\\\\\\\nswitch\\\\\\\\ntable\\\\\\\\ntabs\\\\\\\\ntextarea\\\\\\\\ntoast\\\\\\\\ntoaster\\\\\\\\ntoggle-group\\\\\\\\ntoggle\\\\\\\\ntooltip\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Crystal-Clear Documentation:** UI is Near will be accompanied by detailed and user-friendly documentation, providing developers with comments on how the code works and how to use it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Effortless Integration:** UI is Near will ensure a seamless integration process, reducing development time and eliminating repetitive tasks. As simple as importing a ready-to-use component into a project, or have the possibility to copy/paste the code to customize at will. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**CSS Framework:** In addition to the usual way of using CSS in the current NEAR BOS components, Tailwind CSS will be added to these new components. The new components may be styled in any way people want by taking advantage of the features of Tailwind CSS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Components like shadcn/ui:** Lately, the favorite tool of developers for the creation/utilization of components has been shadcn. That is why we decided to ease this learning and usability curve by bringing the same perspective that shadcn uses for its components.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Timeline:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe project is anticipated to span 3-4 weeks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Milestones:**\\\\\\\\nWork on the 37 components \\\\\\\\nCreate Github repository\\\\\\\\nCreate examples for documentation\\\\\\\\nTesting of components\\\\\\\\nIntegrating of components in the documentation\\\\\\\\nSend to Dev Hub for test run before going live\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Deliverables:**\\\\\\\\n37 components ready to use\\\\\\\\nDocumentation for each component\\\\\\\\nShare Github with Dev Hub\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## The Team:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Gonzalo - Web2 Developer**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a seasoned Full-Stack Developer with over 20 years of experience, I\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve cultivated a strong technical foundation, specializing in client-side and server-side programming, SQL database design and REST API development. I entered the blockchain space in 2023 through Alchemy University. I then participated (and won) in hackathons such as Eth Barcelona and Eth Global Istanbul, this last one with NEAR. Beyond technical skills, I possess a deep understanding of collaborative team dynamics and a commitment to delivering quality results. My journey involves a unique blend of technical expertise, marketing, and branding, acquired through self-driven learning over the past decade. I want to support the initiative by She is Near because I think it is a great project and a tool I would have liked to have during my participation at the hackathon. This is going to help many developers to enter Web3 and use NEAR. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGithub:  https://github.com/gonzalobarria \\\\\\\\nTelegram: https://t.me/dientelargo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Budget for Technical Development:** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDaily hours                  8\\\\\\\\nDays                             5\\\\\\\\nTotal per week             40\\\\\\\\nWeeks                          3,5\\\\\\\\nTOTAL Project (hours)  140\\\\\\\\nCost per hou                43\\\\\\\\nTotal Cost                     6020\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Waleska - Project Manager**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\u{2019}m an entrepreneur with proficiency in diverse disciplines, spanning from Arts and Human Development to Technology and AI.
