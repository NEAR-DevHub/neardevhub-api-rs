To get started, all you need is some spare time, a computer with Node.js installed, and a GitHub account.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## New to NEAR?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\'re new in the ecosystem, consider contributing by choosing a specific topic and following the documentation from start to finish. For instance, you can go through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"building smart contracts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" docs and take notes on any areas where you face challenges\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA web developer with real world experience in building applications (specially backend technologies) should be able to go through the docs. If you have such expertise and do not manage to understand the docs, then you have found a documentation problem! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, reach out through Telegram or Discord to seek clarification and then contribute by improving the docs to benefit others with your newfound knowledge.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Forking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a local instance of the docs: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Fork the official docs repository \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. Navigate to the `website` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. Install all dependencies by running (`npm install`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. Start a local version of the docs by running (`npm start`). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Modifying an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Locate the relevant markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Edit the markdown file to make your desired changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you dont know which article corresponds to a specific markdown file, simply use the `Edit this page` button at the end of every article.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Creating an Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo create a new article:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs` folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Add the new article to the `sidebar.json` file. This will add it to the navigation sidebar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAwesome! you\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve successfully added new content to the docs \\\\\\\\u{1f680}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBut keep in mind, building good documentation can be a challenging task and yet...surprisingly straightforward.
