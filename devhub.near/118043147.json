The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\nNearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\nLegacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/)) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15)); \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players\\\\\\\\n- Contract connect methods updated to use MNW. Wallet selector will be added to BOS version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are currently working the following points on V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Tokens:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Add SBT token support - Postponed until finalised ([link](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/504))\\\\\\\\n- Transaction execution enhancements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #2 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are continuing our attempts to support the ecosystem where best we can, with a number of ongoing requests for additional API data endpoints being worked on for multiple use cases such as taxation, validator stats and wallet support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #3 (month 6-9) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithin this milestone we have successfully deployed nearblocks.io on BOS. With this deployment, users can enjoy a faster web experience and developers can leverage a suite of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearblocksonbos.near) - check Widgets tab) we have made available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Other feature requests and improvements done within this milestone : **\\\\\\\\n- Contract interactions with embedded ABI ;\\\\\\\\n- Near.social comments section on addresses, transactions and token pages;\\\\\\\\n- Wallet selector integration for contract interactions ;\\\\\\\\n- Additional API endpoints for API users (balance history) ;\\\\\\\\n- Dark mode ;\\\\\\\\n- A new way of visualising a transaction execution plan ([link](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9gQFCZZN2EzjssZkRVZBmgiYjHqfwSAgwX2D62sUhnhP?tab=execution)) ;\\\\\\\\nFT & NFT holder count in real-time ;\\\\\\\\n- Validator explorer ([link](https://nearblocks.io/node-explorer)).\\\\\\\\n- Our public roadmap for milestone #3 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/3).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Milestone #4 goals (month 9-12)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks schema and infrastructure was updated over the past 3 months. A number of breaking changes were forced to be introduced to the API has resulted in significant speed improvements. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are continuing to explore data partitioning and compression to be able to scale. For the upcoming milestone will we be focusing on new features, including : \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**A light version of the nearblocks explorer.** This will be hosted on BOS and use data backed fully by RPC nodes. The goal will be to offer an alternative data source should NEAR Lake fall out of sync. Users will be able to select the RPC nodes they use for speed and/or uptime ; \\\\\\\\n**DEX Analytics.** We will be adding more analytics on trades, token prices, charts and liquidity pairs ;\\\\\\\\n**Aurora integration.** Initial discussions around integrating Aurora transactions within the nearblocks.io UI ; \\\\\\\\n**Token publishing section.** Integrating near.social feed on token pages ; \\\\\\\\n**Remaining milestone #3 items.** Associated contracts, contract verification, contract analytics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #4 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/4).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe highly appreciate Devhub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s support and are committed to continuing the nearblocks journey!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"labels\": []}"

The rewrite on BOS and updated indexer we have coded V3 - which we aim to publish by the end of January / early February 2024. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the incident caused by the NEAT inscription our focus shifted to our infrastructure. The incident highlighted a bottleneck issue, which we were able to fix and sustain subsequent inscriptions without any impact to the site availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur V3 infrastructure has been focused on building a full high availability design with disaster recovery backup in place. With this new infrastructure in place we are able to tolerate 1 location to be unavailable, at any point in time and continue to operate without any interruption to the end user experience. Our focus for this milestone has been on failover testing and ensuring our code can withstand outages while maintaining the data integrity required of being the near block explorer. For some context, our total in use storage sits at 50TB (inclusive of replicas and disaster recovery). The increased investment in our infrastructure cost we believe is critical to maintain the uptime of Nearblocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will continue to focus on this high availability, our plans will be to have a gateway and BOS selector on Nearblocks, so users can select between: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks on BOS Mainnet\\\\\\\\nNearblocks on BOS Testnet \\\\\\\\nLegacy React app (which will receive only minor updates). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following points are completed and will be published in V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Remaining actions from milestone #1 : Can be [seen here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=iteration%3A%22Iteration+1%22+) in \\\\\\\\u{201c}Done\\\\\\\\u{201d} ;\\\\\\\\n- Updated indexer: Running on mainnet and testnet ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/)) ;\\\\\\\\n- BOS : Publication of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=profile&accountId=nearblocks.near) or search for nearblocks.near [here](https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/component-total)) ; \\\\\\\\n- Validators : Validator section in review ([link](https://beta.nearblocks.io/node-explorer)) ;\\\\\\\\n- Tokens : Additional legacy tokens added ([link](https://github.com/Nearblocks/nearblocks/issues/15)); \\\\\\\\n- Ads: As per request from the ecosystem, we have prepared an ad network for NEAR projects to advertise on Nearblocks. While we know that no one likes ads, the ad revenue will go towards covering the ongoing increased infrastructure costs, and we hope also support Near ecosystem players\\\\\\\\n- Contract connect methods updated to use MNW. Wallet selector will be added to BOS version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are currently working the following points on V3: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Tokens:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Add SBT token support - Postponed until finalised ([link](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/504))\\\\\\\\n- Transaction execution enhancements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #2 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/2). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are continuing our attempts to support the ecosystem where best we can, with a number of ongoing requests for additional API data endpoints being worked on for multiple use cases such as taxation, validator stats and wallet support.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Highlights of milestone #3 (month 6-9) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithin this milestone we have successfully deployed nearblocks.io on BOS. With this deployment, users can enjoy a faster web experience and developers can leverage a suite of BOS components ([link](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearblocksonbos.near) - check Widgets tab) we have made available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Other feature requests and improvements done within this milestone : **\\\\\\\\n- Contract interactions with embedded ABI ;\\\\\\\\n- Near.social comments section on addresses, transactions and token pages;\\\\\\\\n- Wallet selector integration for contract interactions ;\\\\\\\\n- Additional API endpoints for API users (balance history) ;\\\\\\\\n- Dark mode ;\\\\\\\\n- A new way of visualising a transaction execution plan ([link](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9gQFCZZN2EzjssZkRVZBmgiYjHqfwSAgwX2D62sUhnhP?tab=execution)) ;\\\\\\\\nFT & NFT holder count in real-time ;\\\\\\\\n- Validator explorer ([link](https://nearblocks.io/node-explorer)).\\\\\\\\n- Our public roadmap for milestone #3 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/3).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Milestone #4 goals (month 9-12)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearblocks schema and infrastructure was updated over the past 3 months. A number of breaking changes were forced to be introduced to the API has resulted in significant speed improvements. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe are continuing to explore data partitioning and compression to be able to scale. For the upcoming milestone will we be focusing on new features, including : \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**A light version of the nearblocks explorer.** This will be hosted on BOS and use data backed fully by RPC nodes. The goal will be to offer an alternative data source should NEAR Lake fall out of sync. Users will be able to select the RPC nodes they use for speed and/or uptime ; \\\\\\\\n**DEX Analytics.** We will be adding more analytics on trades, token prices, charts and liquidity pairs ;\\\\\\\\n**Aurora integration.** Initial discussions around integrating Aurora transactions within the nearblocks.io UI ; \\\\\\\\n**Token publishing section.** Integrating near.social feed on token pages ; \\\\\\\\n**Remaining milestone #3 items.** Associated contracts, contract verification, contract analytics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur public roadmap for milestone #4 can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/Nearblocks/projects/2/views/4).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe highly appreciate Devhub\\\\\\\\u{2019}s support and are committed to continuing the nearblocks journey!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", \"linked_proposals\": [], \"receiver_account\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"requested_sponsor\": \"neardevdao.near\", \"proposal_body_version\": \"V0\", \"requested_sponsorship_usd_amount\": \"75000\", \"requested_sponsorship_paid_in_currency\": \"NEAR\"}, \"author_id\": \"nearblocks_io.near\", \"snapshot_history\": [], \"social_db_post_block_height\": \"0\"}}"
